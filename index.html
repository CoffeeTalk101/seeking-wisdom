      <div class="calibre_rescale_"><p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">Peter Bevelin begins his fascinating book with Confucius' great wisdom: </b></p><p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3"><i class="calibre4">"A man who has committed a mistake and doesn't correct it, is committing another mistake." </i></b></p><p class="calibre2">Seeking Wisdom is the result of Bevelin's learning about attaining wisdom. </p><p class="calibre2">His quest for wisdom originated partly from making mistakes himself and observing those of others but also from the philosophy of super-investor and Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charles Munger. A man whose simplicity and clarity of thought was unequal to anything Bevelin had seen. In addition to naturalist Charles Darwin and Munger, Bevelin cites an encyclopedic range of thinkers: from first-century BCE Roman poet Publius Terentius to Mark Twain-from Albert Einstein to Richard Feynman-from 16th Century French essayist Michel de Montaigne to Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett. In the book, he describes ideas and research findings from many different fields. This book is for those who love the constant search for knowledge. It is in the spirit of Charles Munger, who says, "All I want to know is where I'm going to die so I'll never go there." </p><p class="calibre2">There are roads that lead to unhappiness. An understanding of how and why we can "die" should help us avoid them. We can't eliminate mistakes, but we can prevent those that can really hurt us. Using exemplars of clear thinking and attained wisdom, Bevelin focuses on how our thoughts are influenced, why we make misjudgments and tools to improve our thinking.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre2">Bevelin tackles such eternal questions as:&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre2"></p><ul class="calibre5"><li class="calibre6">Why do we behave like we do?&nbsp;</li><li class="calibre6">What do we want out of life?&nbsp;</li><li class="calibre6">What interferes with our goals?&nbsp;</li></ul>Read and study this wonderful multidisciplinary exploration of wisdom. It may change the way you think and act in business and in life.

    <p class="calibre2">A man who has committed a mistake and doesn't correct it, is committing another mistake.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">- Confucius (Chinese thinker, 6th to 5th Century BC)</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Why do we behave like we do? American writer Mark Twain once wrote: "The character of the human race never changes, it is permanent." Why is it so?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">What do we want out of life? To be healthy, happy with our families, in our work, etc? What interferes with this? Isn't it often emotions like fear, anger, worry, disappointment, stress, and sadness caused by problems, mistakes, losses, or unreal expectations? Maybe we misjudged people, situations, the time or some investment.We chose the wrong occupation, spouse, investment, or place to live. Why?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">This book is about searching for wisdom. It is in the spirit of Charles Munger, Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. who says, ''All I want to know is where I'm going to die so I'll never go there." There are roads that lead to unhappiness. An understanding of how and why we can "die" should help us avoid them.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">This book focuses on how our thoughts are influenced, why we make misjudgments and tools to improve our thinking. If we understand what influences us, we might avoid certain traps and understand why others act like they do. And if we learn and understand what works and doesn't work and find some framework for reasoning, we will make better judgments. We can't eliminate mistakes, but we can prevent those that can really hurt us.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">How do we achieve wisdom? It is hard to improve ourselves simply by looking at our own mistakes. The best way to learn what, how and why things work is to learn from others. Charles Munger says, "I believe in the discipline of mastering the best that other people have ever figured out.I don't believe in just sitting down and trying to dream it all up <span>y</span><span>ourself </span>Nobody's that <span>smart. </span>"</p>
    <p class="calibre2">The 16th Century French essayist Michel de Montaigne said: ''Anyone who</p>
    <p class="calibre2">wishes to be cured of ignorance must first admit to it." My quest for wisdom originates partly from making mistakes myself and observing those of others but also from the philosophy of Charles Munger. A man whose simplicity and clarity of thought is unequal to anything I have seen. What especially influenced me</p>

    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">were his lectures on worldly wisdom, many of them reproduced in the newsletter <span>Outstanding Investor Digest. </span>In one speech, he said that the best way to achieve wisdom was to learn the big ideas that underlie reality. <span>In </span>another, he referred to Charles Darwin as one of the best thinkers who ever lived. Darwin's lesson is that even people who aren't geniuses can outthink the rest of mankind if they develop certain thinking habits.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">To learn more about Darwin's habits, I started to read his autobiography and other writings about him. I found him to be a fascinating character and a wonderful lesson on objectivity. <span>In </span>his autobiography, Darwin said:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">I think that I am superior to the common run of men in noticing things which easily escape attention, and in observing them carefully. My industry has been nearly as great as it could have been in the observation and collection of facts. What is far more important, my love of natural science has been steady and ardent... From my early youth I have had the strongest desire to understand or explain whatever I observed, that is, to group all facts under some general laws. These causes combined have given me the patience to reflect or ponder for any number of years over any unexplained problem. <span>As </span>far as I can judge, I am not apt to follow blindly the lead of other men. I have steadily endeavoured to keep my mind free so as <span>to </span>give up any hypothesis, however much beloved (and I cannot resist forming one on every subject), as soon as facts are shown to be opposed to it.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Darwin reinforced my interest in understanding human behavior. To improve my own thinking, I read books in biology, psychology, neuroscience, physics, and mathematics. <span>fu </span>the 17th Century French philosopher Rene Descartes said: "The reading of all good books is like conversation with the finest minds of past centuries."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">I started to write down what I learned. The result is this book. The ideas in it are built largely from the works and thoughts of others. <span>fu </span>the Roman poet Publius Terentius (c.190-159 BC) wrote: "Nothing has yet been said that's not been said before." I have condensed what others have written in a usable form and added my own conclusions.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">In this book you find a broad-based collection of wisdom from outstanding scientists like Darwin, Albert Einstein, Richard Feynman, and two of the world's most successful businessmen and investors, Charles Munger and the Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett. Albert Einstein once said that there are only a few enlightened people with a lucid mind and good taste within a century. Warren Buffett and Charles Munger are such people. I owe a great debt to them whose messages have been instructional as well as encouraging. lfl had listened</p>

    <p class="calibre2">to them earlier in my life - so many expensive mistakes would have been avoided. They are my heroes!</p>
    <p class="calibre2">I advise all of you to read the annual reports of Berkshire Hathaway and Wesco Financial (Charles Munger is chairman). These reports are the best educational tools about how to think about investing and business. The lessons also show us how to behave in life.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">This book has four parts. First, I explore what influences our thinking. This serves as a foundation. In the second part, I give examples of psychological reasons for misjudgments. The third part explores reasons for misjudgments caused both by our psychology and a lack of considering some basic ideas from physics and mathematics. <span>In </span>the final part I reveal tools for better thinking. The appendix contains a speech from Charles Munger and quotes from Munger and Warren Buffett. <span>It </span>also contains checklists. Checklists often eliminate biases and make it easier for us to be sure we've covered the important things.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Why spend time studying wisdom? Charles Munger gives a compelling reason: "I think it's a <span>huge </span>mistake not to absorb elementary worldly wisdom if you're capable of doing it because it makes you better able to serve others, it makes you better able to serve yourself and it makes life more fun.. .I'm passionate about <span>wisdom. </span>I'm passionate about <span>accuracy </span>and some kinds of <span>curiosity."</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2">This book is for those who love the constant search for knowledge. I have focused on explaining timeless ideas. The number of pages I have devoted to each idea does not reflect on its importance. My goal is to lay the foundation.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">16th Century Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes said: "He that publishes a book runs a very great hazard, since nothing can be more impossible than to compose one that may secure the approbation of every reader." You may feel that much has been ignored and what is left has been exaggerated. Since I am writing this, I take full responsibility for the content. Any mistakes or inaccuracies are my responsibility. If you, the reader, are convinced that I am dearly wrong about anything in this book, please send me an e-mail at the address given in the beginning of the book.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">I have cited quotations from a wide range of sources. Some books and material have been especially useful. Obviously, books about Charles Darwin. Also speeches and reports from Charles Munger and Warren Buffett. Most of these quotes are excerpted text from the excellent newsletter, <span>Outstanding Investor Digest. </span>The reader should refer to the source note section for the source of the excerpt. Robert Cialdini, Regents Professor of Psychology at Arizona State University, gives an excellent summary of findings in social psychology in his great book <span>Influence. </span>Psychology Professors Daniel Kahneman and the late Amos</p>

    <p class="calibre2"><a id="calibre_link-17">Tversky's work on decision-making has also been useful. Richard Feynman (1918-1988), perhaps the most brilliant and influential physicist of modern times, was also a spellbinding teacher. </a><span>I </span>love his books and autobiographies. The late Human Ecology Professor Garrett Hardin is one of my favorites. His books are treasures and offer many ways for dear thinking. <span>I </span>have also been fortunate <span>to </span>visit the Neurosciences Institute in California. Every time I'm there, <span>I </span>learn something new about how our brain works.<a id="calibre_link-18">â</a></p>
    <p class="calibre2"><span>I </span>sometimes write in terms of "we", and other times <span>I </span>address "you", the reader. Just remember, "you" includes me, the writer. Italian mathematician and philosopher Gian-Carlo Rota's said in <span>Indiscrete Thoughts: </span>"The advice we give others is the advice that we ourselves need."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Instead of writing "he" <span>or </span>"she", <span>I </span>have used "he". To quote the British zoologist, Professor of the public understanding of Science at Oxford University, Richard Dawkins from <span>The Blind"Watchmaker: </span><span>"I </span>may refer to the 'reader' as 'he', but <span>I </span>no more think of my readers as specifically male than a French speaker thinks of a table as female."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Let's start the journey for wisdom. I hope it will be inspiring.</p>

      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">And men should know that from nothing else but from the brain come joys, laughter and jests, and sorrows, grief, despondency and lamentations. And by this <span>... </span>we acquire wisdom and knowledge, and we see and hear and know what are foul and what are fair, what sweet and what unsavory... and by the same organ we become mad and delirious and fears and terrors assail us.</p>

    <p class="calibre2">OUR ANATOMY SETS THE LIMITS FOR OUR BEHAVIOR</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">To understand the way we think and why we make misjudgments, we must first determine what influences our behavior.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Why <span>can't we </span>fly?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">To do what we do today demands the proper anatomical foundation. To fly we need wings. To walk we need legs, to see we need eyes, and to think we need a brain. Our anatomy, physiology and biochemistry are the fundamental bases for our behavior.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">If <span>we change anatomy, we change behavior. Birds can't fly if their wings are</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2">located in an area where no bones are present to anchor them. Apes can't talk because they need speech organs and these must be positioned in a certain way. For example, a small change in how our speech organs are positioned could make speech impossible.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Another example on how a change in anatomy changes behavior comes from the Neurosciences Institute in California. <span>In </span>one experiment, scientists took a small portion of developing brain tissue from a quail and put it into the same spot of a chicken embryo. When the chick hatched, it had both quail and chicken nerve cells. Depending on what cells were transplanted, the results were either a chicken that crowed like a quail or a chicken that bobbed its head like a quail.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Studies have also shown that damage to a part of the brain, the prefrontal cortex (lying behind the forehead and eyes), results in a tendency to show a high degree of disrespect for social norms, including violent behavior. A classic example is that of railway construction foreman Phineas Gage. In 1848, he was victim of an explosion that drove an iron rod through the frontal region of his brain, damaging his prefrontal cortex. Before the accident he was considered stable, dependable, industrious, and friendly. Phineas survived the accident, but his personality changed. He became a drifter who was unreliable, arrogant, impulsive and inconsiderate.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Other studies show that damage to the amygdala- a region of the brain, linked with emotional states and social behavior - reduces the tendency to feel and</p>

    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">3</p>
    <p class="calibre2"><a id="calibre_link-21">respond to fear. Stimulating the amygdala can elicit intense emotional reactions. </a><span>In </span>1966, Charles Whitman killed 14 people and wounded 38 from the clock tower at the University of Texas, Austin. An autopsy revealed he had a tumor pressing against his amygdala.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">It is our brain, its anatomy, physiology and biochemistry and how these parts function that set the limits for how we think. But since our brain's parts also interact with our body's anatomy, physiology and biochemistry, we must see brain and body together. They are part of the same system - us.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Let's consider the anatomy of our brains to get a better understanding of what influences our behavior.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">What we <span>feel </span>and <span>think </span>depends on neural connections</p>
    <p class="calibre2">A lot is known about the brain, but far from everything. There are many controversies and unanswered questions.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Nobel Laureate Dr. Gerald Edelman, director of the Neurosciences Institute says:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">The brain is the most complicated material object in the known universe. <span>If </span>you attempted to count the number of connections, one per second, in the mantle of our brain (the cerebral cortex), you would finish counting 32 million years later. But that is not the whole story. The way the brain is connected - its neuroanatomical pattern - is enormously intricate. Within this anatomy a remarkable set of dynamic events take place in hundredths of a second and the number oflevels controlling these events, from molecules to behavior, is quite large.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Weighing only three pounds, the brain is composed of at least 100 billion nerve cells or neurons. <span>It </span>also contains tens of billions of other cells called glial cells supporting neurons. Neurons are connected to other neurons and interact. Each neuron has a cell body with tiny branches called dendrites that receive information from other neurons. Extending from the cell body is long fibers called axons that send information to other neurons.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Since it is the connections between neurons that cause our mental capacities, it is not the number of cells that is important but the number of potential connections between them.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">How do neurons connect and communicate?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Every neuron can connect with other neurons at contact points, the space between one neuron and another, called synapses. When a neuron fire an electrical impulse down the axon, the impulse is released as a chemical substance</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">4</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <a id="calibre_link-22">called a neurotransmitter. When this chemical reaches the dendrite of another neuron it triggers an electrical impulse. Thereafter a series of chemical reactions begins. Some stimulation must happen for the neuron to fire. The strength of this firing and what kind of neurotransmitter is released depends on the incoming stimuli.</a>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">How does the neurotransmitter cause the electrical impulse? On the surface of the receiving neuron are proteins called receptors and every receptor is tailor made for a specific chemical. The chemical acts as a key, and the receptor, or the lock, only "lets in" the right chemical.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Why does it feel good when our loved ones give us a kiss or a compliment?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">It is the neurotransmitter dopamine that is being released. Dopamine is involved in the brain's reward and motivation system, and in addiction. High levels of dopamine are believed to increase feelings of pleasure and relieve pain.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Another neurotransmitter is serotonin. Serotonin is linked with mood and emotion. Too much stress can lead to low levels of serotonin and low levels are associated with anxiety and depression. What happens when we take an antidepressant drug? The drug increases the amount of serotonin in our brain. The drug mimics the structure of serotonin. Antidepressants don't make us happy; they just treat the state of unhappiness. Observe that even if neurotransmitters and the drugs that affect them alter our mental functions, they are part of a complicated system of interactions between molecules, cells, synapses, and other systems, including life experiences and environmental factors.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">So far we know that the brain is a chemical system, and that neurons commu nicate with each other through the release of neurotransmitters (chemicals that carry messages between neurons). What we think and feel depends on chemical reactions. And these chemical reactions are a function of how our neurons connect. What determines how these neurons connect and their patterns? Our genes and life experiences, situational or environmental conditions, and a degree of</p>
    <p class="calibre2">randomness.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Genes control brain chemistry but are turned on and off by the environment</p>
    <p class="calibre2">What is a gene? What does it do?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Genes are what makes an individual, for example, to be built with two blue eyes, two arms, one nose, and a brain with certain architecture.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Our body is made up of different types of interconnected cells functioning together. Each cell has 46 chromosomes or a chain of genes. 23 chromosomes come from each parent. Every chromosome is made up of the chemical DNA or</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">5</p>
    <p class="calibre2">deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA is our inheritance; half is from our father and half from our mother. Genes are segments of our DNA and the units of our inheritance. A gene consists of four chemical molecules: adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine or A, C, G and T joined together in a chain. The short chemical name for a chain of any number of these molecules, in any order, is DNA. The order of these molecules provides coded instructions for everything a cell does.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">The job of genes is to make proteins - the building blocks oflife. Proteins are molecules that carry out most of our biological functions and are made up of amino acids. There are twenty kinds of amino acids that can be used to make our skin, hair, muscles, etc. Some proteins called enzymes cause certain chemical reactions. One example is neurotransmitters. Proteins are also hormones that act as messengers between our cells.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Sometimes a gene is "switched off" and can't make proteins. Messenger RNA is a genetic material that translates DNA into specific proteins. The Laureates of the Nobel Prize in Medicine, 2006, discovered a mechanism called RNA interference that could "switch off" a gene by blocking this process. RNA interference plays a key role in our defenses against viral infections.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Recent studies also suggest that genes do more than make proteins. For example, there is a gene in yeast that turns on and off another protein-producing gene without making any protein itself</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Every living thing uses the same genetic code - from cats to humans. This means we can transfer a single human gene into a cat and the cat "can read it" and follow its instructions. But no individual has the same DNA or the same versions of genes (except for identical twins). Not all things are "spelled" alike. That's why people differ in eye color, height, etc. The closer related one living thing is to another, the fewer spelling differences. But even if the differences are small, gene expression - where and when they are turned on or off and for how long - is the key. As an example take our closest relative - the chimpanzee. Genetic studies show that humans and chimpanzees share at least 94% of their DNA sequences. This means that less than 6% of our DNA is responsible for the traits that make us different from chimpanzees. What causes the large difference in behavior? Studies show that the human brain shows strikingly different patterns of gene expression compared to the chimpanzee's brain.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Since we inherit all of our genes from our parents, why don't we look like a mixture of them?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">In most organisms, genes come in pairs. We inherit two versions of each gene for</p>
    <p class="calibre2">a particular trait (for example one version for blue eyes and one for brown eyes)</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">6</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <a id="calibre_link-23">from each parent. When a father and mother's genes combine, the effect of one gene may dominate the effect of the other. Certain characteristics are dominant. This is why a child who has one parent with blue eyes and one with brown doesn't have eyes that are a blend of blue and brown. The child has brown eyes because the brown-eyed gene won the race. Blue eyes are recessive. But since the child inherited the blue-eyed gene, it could still be passed on to future generations. Since the recombination of the versions happens by chance, they can always produce a new combination. On the other hand, if both the child's parents have blue eyes, the child has no choice but to be blue-eyed.</a>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Some versions of genes are dominant, in some cases they blend, and sometimes we'll see an equal expression of both versions. Since several pairs of genes govern most traits, lots of combinations are possible.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Interaction and flexibility characterize our biological functions</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Does each gene have its own specific part to play?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">No, we can't isolate one gene as causing something or arrange them in order of importance. They are part of an interconnected system with many possible combinations. And most genes contribute to more than one characteristic. Genes can have different effects, depending on where, when and how they are switched on. Interaction is a fundamental property in biology. There are interactions between molecules, genes, neurons, brain regions, cells, organs and among these individual systems. Each system does its own job but they are all coordinated to produce a functional and unique individual.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">But doesn't the left and right side of the brain have different functions? Dr. Ralph Greenspan at the Neurosciences Institute says:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">... although in some sense it's poetic to speak of a "right brain/left brain'' difference. The fact of the matter is that things that are "right brain" are really happening everywhere and things that are "left brain" are really happening everywhere. There are certain aspects ofit that may be more biased to one side versus another, but the brain is not highly localized in any sense at all. Everything that ever happens in your brain is happening as a unification of many, many, many areas at once.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">

    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">He continues:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Isaac Newton might have liked the neat view of biological systems made up of dedicated components, with causal roles that can be studied in isolation, and in which particular conditions give rise <span>to </span>uniquely predictable responses. Charles Darwin, by contrast, might</p>

    <p class="calibre2">
      <a id="calibre_link-24">have felt more at home with the idea of a complex, emergent system made up of many non-identical components, with non-exclusive roles, non-exclusive relationships, several ways of producing any given output, and a great deal of slop along the way.</a>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">The most striking result of our interactive network is flexibility. A flexibility <span>to </span>take on new roles as conditions changes and an ability <span>to </span>produce the same result in different ways. For example, studies show that different configurations between neurons can achieve the same result. The configuration depends on which alternatives that are available at a given moment in a given situation (since behavior depends on context or situation), an individual's life experiences and an element of chance. Having alternative ways of producing the same outcome gives us a great benefit. For example, we can compensate for injuries and readapt <span>to </span>new conditions.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Do our genes have a lift of their own?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">No, gene expression depends on environmental conditions. Genes control the chemistry in the brain but need <span>to </span>be activated by the environment. An environmental event must switch them on, or modify their level of activity, before they can start making proteins that influence neural connections. Our genes determine if we inherit a particular characteristic but it is the environment that causes our genes to make proteins that produce certain "response tendencies." So our behavior emerges from the mutually dependent activity of genetic and environmental factors.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Neural connections are shaped <span>by </span>life experiences</p>
    <p class="calibre2">The brain changes continually as a result of our experiences. Experiences produce physical changes in the brain either through new neural connections or through the generation of new neurons. Studies suggest that the brain can change even during the course of a day. This means that the anatomy of the brain varies from individual <span>to </span>individual. Even identical twins with identical genes don't have identical brains. They have had different life experiences.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Experiences are the reason that all individuals are unique. There are no individuals with exactly the same upbringing, nutrition, education, social stamping, physical, social and cultural setting. This creates different convictions, habits, values and character. People behave differently because differences in their environment cause different life experiences. This is why it is sometimes hard <span>to </span>understand other people's behavior. To do that, we must adapt <span>to </span>their environment and share their experiences. This is often impossible.</p>

    <p class="calibre2"><a id="calibre_link-25"><span>If </span></a>we encounter a stressful situation, how we respond depends on what we were born with, what we have experienced, and the specific situation. Assume that a person "Sam" and you both have genes for "being fearful." You are standing in a Savannah in Africa and are approached by a lion. Do both of you show the same reaction when exposed <span>to </span>the same situation? You are afraid but not Sam. Sam either knows that this lion is tame or Sam is a lion tamer. Sam's reaction comes from his life experiences. Sam may also be genetically predisposed to react differently to certain dangers. But even if Sam has a low genetic vulnerability to fear, he can develop a fear of the lion. One horrifying experience with a lion may be enough.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">A placebo effect is a positive therapeutic effect that has nothing to do with the efficiency of a treatment, only with a patient's belief in the treatment. Whenever patients believe that a treatment will have a particular physiological, behavioral, or psychological effect, they are susceptible to placebo effects.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">A placebo is an inactive or ineffective treatment or substance (for example, sugar pills or injections with saline solution) that is often used in comparison with active treatments. Studies show that a placebo can improve a patient's condition simply because the patient expects it will work. Clinical evidence shows placebos to have physical effects on the brain, just as drugs do. Studies in Sweden show that a placebo activates the same brain circuits as painkilling drugs. Nine male</p>

        <p class="calibre2">9</p>
        <p class="calibre2">students were asked to voluntary participate in a study of painkilling drugs. Researchers first tested for the degree of pain the subjects would experience when a 48-degree Celsius metal surface was pressed to the backs of their hands. The test was repeated after the subjects were given a painkilling drug.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Later the subjects were told to test two new painkilling drugs and that one of these drugs was similar to the one they earlier tested. Once more the 48-degree metal surface was pressed to the backs of their hands. A man in a white coat, carrying a badge that said "professor", then entered the room. The "professor" gave the subjects intravenous injections of either an opioid (a drug acting like a drug made from opium) painkiller or a placebo. During the experiment researchers scanned the subjects' brains and compared brain responses. Both the painkiller and the placebo produced the same effect. Both increased blood flow in areas of the brain known to be rich in opioid receptors. Eight of the nine subjects said that the placebo produced a clear relief from the pain.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Other studies show that people who take sugar pills as a treatment for depression and other ills can undergo striking, although temporary, changes in brain activity and neural chemistry as their condition improves. It has also been shown that placebos can improve blood pressure, cholesterol level and heart rate. It's like a pharmacy inside the body that has evolved during million of years of evolutionary time.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">What happens when a healthy person finds out he may die?</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Studies show that if people expect something to go wrong with their health, it often does. Negative expectations can influence our bodies and cause symptoms that over time may cause our body harm. In one study, women who expected that they were inclined to heart attack were nearly four times as likely to die as women with similar risk factors but without these expectations. Another study found that patients who were warned about the gastrointestinal side effects of taking aspirin were three times more likely to feel them. Other studies show that if people worry about drug side effects, they are more likely to get them. Beliefs have biological consequences - good and bad.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Our genes and life experiences determine how neurons connect thereby influencing and setting the limits for our behavior. We were born with the basics of life. We had neural connections that regulated our breathing, heartbeat, temperature, etc. How does our brain select those neural connections that produce useful behavior? Our brain is a product of evolution.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">Evolution is change (structural, physiological, behavioral) - which occurs over time through interaction with the environment. Paleontology Professor John Horner says in <span>Dinosaur Lives: </span>"When you flip through the pages of the family album you're witnessing evolution at work."</p>
        <p class="calibre2">The theory behind evolution is that all individuals alive today have evolved from simpler, more primitive forms oflife. Since every living thing uses the same genetic code, it is likely that life descended from a distant common ancestor that had that code. <span>If </span>a monkey and we and any other organism trace our ancestors back far enough, we eventually find a common ancestor.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">Mutations cause variations</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Mutations are caused by a copying error in the sequence of A, C, G and T molecules when DNA is copied. This error in the genes "spelling" may cause a change in a protein leading to a modification in the individual that inherits the gene. For example, the new instruction could be"build Peter with adifferent eye-color." Since the change is random and unpredictable, no one can tell which gene(s) may be involved.</p>

    <p class="calibre2">Charles Darwin, and independently the British naturalist Alfred Russell Wallace, discovered the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin called his work <span>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life.</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2">Darwin was inspired by the Reverend Thomas Malthus's <span>An Essay on the</span></p>

    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">11</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <a id="calibre_link-30">Principle of Population </a>
      <span>in which Malthus wrote: "Human population grows exponentially, like compound interest in a bank account, but farm output rises at a slower, arithmetic rate; the result, human population will inevitably and repeatedly outstrip its food supply." Malthus noted that population can always outstrip resources but are held in check by diseases, war, predators, and by limited resources like food.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Darwin made the following three observations:</p>
    <p class="calibre2"><i class="calibre4">(I) </i><span>Competition and environmental change. </span>In most species (a species is a group of individuals capable of producing fertile offspring; like snakes, lion, humans) there are always more offspring born than can survive to adulthood and reproduce. Darwin saw two reasons for this: <span>(1) </span>Since there is a limited amount of resources (like food, space, mates) there is competition between individuals for these resources, and (2) Since the environment changes over time and from one region to another, there are threats (predators, change in climate, isolation, diseases, change in the physical environment) to the children's survival and their reproductive success.</p>
    <ol id="calibre_link-31" class="calibre11">
      <li class="calibre6">
        <p class="calibre2">Individual variability. <span>Within a species, there is an enormous amount of</span></p>
        <p class="calibre2">individual variation. No two individuals of the same species are alike in their anatomical structure, physiology or behavior (we're not an exact copy of our parents). Individuals vary in their cell structure, fighting ability, and social skills. Variations make every individual unique and that variation must in some way be heritable otherwise children wouldn't resemble their parents more than they resemble other individuals.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="calibre6">
        <p class="calibre2">The world is not fixed but evolving. <span>Species change, new ones arrive and</span></p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="calibre2">others go extinct.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Darwin called his principle natural selection. Any slight variation in traits that gives an individual an advantage in competing with other individuals of the same or different species or in adapting to changes in their environment increases the chance that the individual will survive, reproduce, and pass along its characteristics to the next generation. Maybe they have greater resistance to disease, or can run faster, or survive climate changes better.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Darwin used the word "selection," but nature doesn't care who gets selected for survival. Evolution has no goal. Another way to describe natural selection is as a process of elimination. Certain individuals survive because they have structural, physiological, behavioral or other characteristics that prevent them from being eliminated. Those that don't have these characteristics are eliminated. Heredity enhances the likelihood that the non-eliminated or "selected" variations</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">12</p>
    <p class="calibre2">are preserved. Darwin didn't know about genetics. Therefore he couldn't know that these characteristics were caused by mutations and that they could be passed on through the genes.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">After a mutation changes an individual, the environment determines if the change gives the individual an advantage. <span>If </span>the new trait is helpful, the mutated individual is more likely to survive, reproduce and pass the new trait to his children. Take a poisonous spider as an example. Assume that a population (a group of individuals belonging to one species that occupy the same geographic/ecological niche at the same time) of black widows differs in how toxic their venom is. <span>If </span>some spiders (mutants) are born with more toxins than others, two things could happen over time. <span>If </span>more toxins give an advantage in the spiders' environment, more toxins might be "selected" for and the "more-toxins" characteristic might be passed to children. <span>If </span>the more toxic black widow spiders survive and reproduce better than the less toxic ones, then black widow spiders, will, over time, evolve more toxic venom. The frequency of the "more-toxic" spiders in the population increases over time. <span>If </span>there is no advantage, the trait disappears and</p>
    <p class="calibre2">the population of less toxic spiders increases.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">When organisms undergo selection, some characteristic may be carried along that wasn't selected. Even if some trait didn't provide an advantage it could still be carried along as long as it isn't harmful, i.e., doesn't negatively influence survival and reproduction. But a situation may arise in the future when that trait can become useful.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">What happens when the environment changes?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Since environments change over time and with geography, different variants are "selected" under different conditions. Characteristics that are successful in one environment may be unsuccessful in another. This is well expressed by the late American paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould in <span>Wonderful Life: </span>"Even if fishes hone their adaptations to peaks of aquatic perfection, they will all die if the ponds dry up."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Studies show that different organisms respond differently to environmental stress. But there seems to be one creature that survives and reproduces independent of changes and stresses in the environment - the cockroach. Writer Richard Schweid says in <span>The Cockroach Papers, </span><span>"If </span>there is a God that made all life forms, a particularly rich blessing was bestowed on the roach, because it got the best design of all."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">The cockroach is the oldest insect on our planet as evidenced by fossil records dating back 325 million years. It can eat almost anything, live 45 days without</p>
    <p class="calibre2">

    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">13</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <a id="calibre_link-32">food, and has an effective reproductive system with female sperm storing capabilities lasting a lifetime and a great defense system. The cockroach is about the same organism it was millions of years ago because its characteristics were adaptive then and now.</a>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Often a new trait or a change in an individual doesn't occur through a single step but through a gradual accumulation of small mutations being selected over a long period of time. By dating meteorites, most scientists say that the earth is about 4.6 billion years old. The oldest bacteria fossils go back 3.5 billion years. Given enough variation and time, even such a complicated thing as the eye hasgradually developed. Evolutionary changes can act fast. Studies of fruit flies show that differences in wing size could take place in as little time as adecade. A change in a species' territory (e.g. climatic) can also bring on rapid structural changes (variation). Other studies show that a change that involves few genes could come about faster (and cause large</p>
    <p class="calibre2">behavioral changes) than one that depends on small changes in many genes.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Mutation is not the only source of genetic variation. Other mechanisms (sometimes interacting) are genetic drift, gene flow, and symbiosis. Genetic drift happens when random events cause gene frequencies to vary between generations (more important in small populations). Gene flow or migration is the movement of genes in a species from one population to another as the result of interbreeding. For example, there is evidence of gene flow between cultivated plants and their wild relatives. Symbiosis is the cooperative interaction between different organisms that can produce genetic changes. There is also co-evolution or the parallel evolution of two species. Another source of variation is gene duplication or the accidental duplication of entire genes. So natural selection is not the only mechanism that changes organisms over time. But it is the only known process that seems to adapt organisms over time.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">The evidence for evolution</p>
    <p class="calibre2">There is fossil, anatomical and molecular evidence of evolution. The fossil record shows how morphology was modified. Similarities of organs in related organisms show common ancestry. There is also DNA fossils evidence where human relative relatedness can be measured by DNA sequencing.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">One example of evolution is industrial melanism. Before the Industrial Revolution in England, the color of the peppered moth was mainly light. When there was no industrial pollution, the darker moth cropped up by mutation. But since the darker moths were easier to spot against the tree bark, hungry birds snapped them up. Only when the environment changed, when soot from new factories covered the tree trunks, did darkness became an advantage. Selection</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">14</p>
    <p class="calibre2">began to favor the darker moth. Darker moths were better disguised on tree trunks covered by soot. The lighter moths were eaten and the darker ones increased in numbers. Around 1950 the environment started changing again. A decrease in the use of coal and better filtering equipment in the factories produced a cleaner environment and the peppered moth is in the process of returning to its lighter color.</p>

    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Why aren't antibiotics as effective against dangerous bacteria as before?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Evolution is at work today. Evidence of evolution is seen in pesticide resistance among insects and the antibiotic resistance of bacteria.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">There are a lot of bacteria around, and they can divide several times an hour. In any population of bacteria, there are some individuals that through mutations have developed genes causing them to escape elimination. The more non resistant bacteria that are eliminated, the more opportunities for the resistant to reproduce and spread. Over time, the resistant bugs win the race, meaning the antibiotics become less and less effective. Until someone develops a new type of antibiotic and then the race starts all over again.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Bacteria are immensely adaptable. Expose them to antibiotics long enough, they adapt and find a way to survive. This also means that the more we use antibiotics, the faster resistance spreads. And any method we use to kill bugs will, unless it completely wipes out a species, cause a population of resistant bugs.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Just as we can't blame an animal for eating another animal to survive, we can't blame bacteria for giving us an infection. They have no intention of harming us. Bacteria do what comes natural to all of us - survive and reproduce.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Are bacteria always bad far us?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">No, they are important for our digestion and immune system. They are also vital for life on earth. Without them we wouldn't exist. In order to generate energy, we need oxygen. This oxygen is assumed to have been generated by a group of bacteria called cyanobacteria (or blue-green algae), the light-harnessing microbes that live primarily in seawater.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">The key source of energy for nearly all life is sunlight. This light energy is transformed into chemical energy in plants, algae and certain bacteria by photosynthesis. For example, plants make their food- usually glucose-from carbon dioxide (through leaves) and water (mainly through roots). Sunlight provides the energy needed to run the biochemical process that yields sugar and the by-product oxygen (that water molecules contain) which is released into the atmosphere. When we eat plants (or animals that eat plants), we take in their stored energy.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">

    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">15</p>
    <p class="calibre2"><a id="calibre_link-33">In plants, photosynthesis is handled by chloroplasts. They contain the molecule chlorophyll, allowing plants to absorb the energy from the sun. Chloroplasts may have evolved from cyanobacteria that were fusioned with plants a long time ago. Fossil evidence shows that there were cyanobacteria-like microbes on earth 3.5 billion years ago. </a><span>It </span>is also believed that mitochondria (the non-bacterial cell structures where oxygen is used to burn food for energy) evolved as a result from a fusion of different kind of bacterial cells.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Another activity of some cyanobacteria is nitrogen fixation. For example, in plants from which beans or peas are taken, bacteria live in the roots and chemically convert (fix) atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia useful to other organ1sms.</p>

      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Why isn't the world covered with dead plants and animals?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Partly because bacteria breaks down the tissue of dead plants and animals into nutrients like carbon and nitrogen that are then released back into the environment.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Go out and look at a recently dead bird. Then look at it a month later. There are only bones left.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Thus, evolution selected the behavior that made our ancestors survive and reproduce. What guidance system has evolution selected to help us make better decisions for survival and reproduction?</p>

    <p class="calibre2">Guidance through values and life experiences <span>Human beings are pulled forward toward and by nature seek pleasure, whereas they flee from and reject pain.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2">What drives us?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">The 17th Century English philosopher John Locke said: "Good and evil, reward and punishment, are the only motives to a rational creature: these are the spur and reins whereby all mankind are set on work, and guided." We are driven by our need to avoid pain (and punishment) and a desire to gain pleasure (and reward). Evolution has made any behavior that helps us survive and reproduce feel pleasurable or rewarding. Behavior that is bad for us feels painful or punishing. Feelings of pain and pleasure are a useful guide to what is good or bad for us. <span>If </span>we eat, we feel pleasure. <span>If </span>we starve ourselves, we feel pain.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Harm avoidance first. Our brain is equipped to register pain more sensitively than any other emotion. We also remember negatively arousing stimuli better.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">16</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Neurology Professor Antonio Damasio says in <span>Descartes' Error </span>that "it is the pain related signal that steers us away from impending trouble." <span>It </span>makes evolutionary sense that we have the desire to avoid pain. Psychology Professor Randolph Nesse and Biology Professor George Williams say in <span>Why We Get Sick: </span>"Pain is the signal that tissue is being damaged. <span>It </span>has to be aversive to motivate us to set aside other activities to do whatever is necessary to stop the damage."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">That we are sensitive to events or stimuli that have painful implications for us, explains why we have such an aversion to loss. Richard Dawkins says in <span>The Blind Watchmaker: </span>"However many ways there may be of being alive, it is certain there are vastly more ways of being dead, or rather not alive." The fear ofloss is much greater than the desire to gain. Research shows that we feel more pain from losing than we feel pleasure from gaining something of equal value and that we work harder to avoid losing than we do to win. That we pay more attention to possible losses than gains makes sense. <span>In </span>Steven Pinker's book, <span>How The Mind Works, </span>social psychologist Timothy Ketelaar says, <span>''As </span>things get better, increases in fitness show diminishing returns: more food is better, but only up to a point. But as things get worse, decreases in fitness can take you out of the game: not enough food and you're dead."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Our aversion to pain also encourages a certain human behavior: to take the most rewarding view of events. We interpret choices and events in ways that make us feel better. We often prefer to hear supporting reasons for our beliefs; think of ourselves as more talented than others, and make the best of bad situations.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">How are certain connections strengthened?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">If <span>certain connections help us interact with our environment, we use them more often than connections that don't help us. Since we use them more often, they become strengthened.</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2">Evolution has given us preferences that help us classify what is good or bad. When these values are satisfied (causing either pleasure or less pain) through the interaction with our environment, these neural connections are strengthened. These values are reinforced over time because they give humans advantages for survival and reproduction in dealing with their environment.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">For example, light is preferred to darkness, eating certain food is better than not eating, etc. When we drank our mother's milk, our brains told us that "eating" was pleasurable. Our chance of survival increased. <span>If </span>we didn't eat after we were born, the feedback from our brain would be that "not eating" was painful. The chances are that we ate in the future. Since the feedback from eating</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">17</p>
    <p class="calibre2">was pleasurable, certain neural connections were strengthened. In the future, when we were exposed to the same stimuli, this group of neurons reacted stronger. Any behavior that we find rewarding, either pleasurable or less painful, are strengthened.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">The connections in our brain are constantly strengthened and weakened, developing and changing. The more we are exposed to certain experiences, the more the specific connections are strengthened, and the better we learn and remember those experiences. We then use these stored representations of what works when we respond to people and situations. Essentially what we do today is a function of what worked in the past. We adapt to our environment by learning from the consequences of our actions. We do things that we associate with pleasure and avoid things that we associate with pain.</p>

    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Does the brain work like a computer <span>- </span>systematically and logically?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">No, it is a selection system that puts together patterns among neurons. Dr. Ralph Greenspan says:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">In no sense does the brain work like a computer. Computers record, and computers have things stored in specific places that are stable. Our brains do none of that. When the great chess master Gary Kasparov lost to Big Blue everybody said "Aha, this machine can think!" Big Blue was not thinking. Big Blue was simply replaying the entire history of chess. That's not the way that Gary Kasparov or any human being plays chess. We do pattern recognition. Even though we are capable of logic, our brain does not operate by the principles oflogic. It operates by selection of pattern recognition. It's a dynamic network. It's not an "if-then" logic machine.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">A chess computer has no pattern-recognizingability. Instead, it explores all the possible moves on a given chessboard. Chess-masters look for patterns and decide what to do based on what have worked well in the past. Why? Because what worked in the past is most likely to work in the future. Warren Buffett follows up with:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">There was a great article in the <span>New </span><span>Yorker </span>magazine ... when the Fischer/Spassky chess matches were going on. And it got into this speculation of whether or not humans would ever be able to take on computers in chess. Here were these computers doing hundreds of thousands of calculations a second. And the article asked, "When all you're really looking</p>
    <p class="calibre2">at is the results from various moves in the future, how can a human mind deal with a computer that's thinking at speeds that are so unbelievable?"...</p>
    <p class="calibre2">

    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">18</p>
    <p class="calibre2"><a id="calibre_link-34">Well, it turns out a mind like... that of a Fischer or a Spassky essentially was eliminating about 99.99% of the possibilities without even </a><span>thinking </span>about 'em. So it wasn't that they could outthink the computer in terms of speed, but they had this ability of what you might call "grouping" or "exclusion", where essentially they just got right down <span>to </span>the few possibilities out of these zillions of possibilities that really had any chance of success.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Now we reach a key question: What part of the value system is called "human nature?"</p>
    <p class="calibre2">So far we've learned that connections between neurons determine how we think and behave. Our genes provide us with the framework for neural development and our life experiences and our environment shapes our brain.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Since the brain is formed by life experiences and since an individual doesn't keep doing what doesn't work (learns through trial and error), evolution has reinforced the behavior and values that help us survive and reproduce. This behavior must be the behavior that was adaptive in the environment in which humans spent most of their evolutionary history. The question then becomes: What was the operating environment in which the human brain evolved?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">The hunter-gatherer environment has formed our basic nature</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Human evolution started about 4 to 7 million years ago and today's "modern" human brain appeared on the scene some 150,000 to 200,000 years ago. For most of that time our ancestors lived in primitive hunter-gatherer societies. These societies existed until the end of the last Ice Age, around 13,000 years ago. Soon thereafter, some 10,000 years ago, agriculture was developed.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">This means that humans have spent more than 99% of their evolutionary history in the hunter gatherer environment. <span>If </span>we compress 4 million years into 24 hours, and if the history of humans began at midnight, agriculture made its appearance on the scene 23 hours and 55 minutes later.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">If <span>the conditions and challenges of the hunter gatherer environment is the</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2">environment in which natural selection has selected the adaptive traits for survival and reproduction, we must find out what the environment looked like back then. What drove our ancestors' evolution? What were the characteristics of the environment that have shaped today's brains? What were the environmental conditions in which the hunter-gatherers lived? What was the availability of resources like food and mates? How was the climate and the geography? Social environment? Size of population? What enemies, predators, and dangers existed? There is no observational evidence from the hunter-gatherer environment. <span>It </span>seems likely though, that the environment of our ancestors represented</p>

    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">19</p>
    <p class="calibre2">ecological, social and human conditions that are quite different from today. People were living in small villages where everyone knew everyone else and strangers didn't show up often. There were enemies, predators and diseases. Limited resources created competition for food and mates.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">What different roles did men and women likely play? Men were responsible for hunting, and defending the group from predators and enemies. Women gathered and prepared food near the home, and cared for the children.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">If this were the environment, what would be appropriate behavior to increase the likelihood for survival and reproduction? What behavior has been natural during 99% of our history?</p>

    <p class="calibre2">Do people do what they perceive is in their best interest?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Yes, one basic trait that all individuals share is self-interest. We are interested in protecting our close family and ourselves. Why?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Since natural selection is about survival and reproduction, and individuals either survive or die and reproduce or not, it makes sense that individuals are predisposed to act in ways that enhance their own prospects for survival and reproduction. The ancestral environment consisted of limited resources, including reproductive resources, and fierce competition. Self-interest came naturally.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">What if our ancestors were composed of altruists - individuals that helped others at their own expense? Altruistic individuals are at a disadvantage. They are always vulnerable <span>to </span>some mutants that take advantage of them. Altruistic behavior cannot evolve by natural selection since natural selection favors individuals that are best at promoting their own survival and reproductive success. Only behavior that is selfish or for the mutual good is in an individual's self-interest and therefore favored by natural selection. Some behavior may under certain conditions look like altruism but can often be explained by self-benefit. Social recognition, prestige, fear of social disapproval, shame, relief from distress, avoidance of guilt, a better after-life or social expectations are some reasons behind "altruistic" acts.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">But how did our social and moral qualities develop? <span>As </span>Charles Darwin wrote in</p>

      <a id="calibre_link-37">The love of approbation and the dread ofinfamy, as well as the bestowal of praise or blame, are primarily due... to the instinct of sympathy; and this instinct no doubt was originally acquired, like all the other social instincts, through natural selection ... We may therefore conclude that primeval man, at a very remote period, would have been influenced by the praise and blame of his fellows. It is obvious, that the members of the same tribe would approve of conduct which appeared to them to be for the general good, and would reprobate that which appeared evil. To do good unto others -to do unto others as ye would they should do unto you, - is the foundation-stone of morality. It is, therefore, hardly possible to exaggerate the importance during rude times of the love of praise and the dread of blame. A man who was not impelled by any deep, instinctive feeling, to sacrifice his life for the good of others, yet was roused to such actions by a sense of glory, would by his example excite the same wish for glory in other men, and would strengthen by exercise the noble feeling of admiration. He might thus do far more good to his tribe than by begetting offspring with a tendency to inherit his own high character.</a>

    <p class="calibre2">If <span>people aren't altruistic by nature, are they cooperative?</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2">Mutual aid has tremendous survival value. But under what conditions do people cooperate? The game of the Prisoner's Dilemma may shed light on this: Suppose you and a partner commit burglary. Both of you are picked up by the police who then question you one by one. There is not enough evidence to convict you unless one of you confesses. The interrogator gives you a choice to cooperate or not.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">

    <p class="calibre2">does. From an outsider's perspective, it seems that both of you would be better off denying the crime (1 year). But from your point of view, it seems best to confess (freedom). The problem is that you don't know what your partner will do. <span>If </span>your partner betrays you, it is better that you also betray him and get 3 years in prison, instead of the 10 years you get if you deny, but your partner ends up confessing. <span>If </span>on the other hand your partner denies, it is still better that you confess because this way you will be free, instead of the 1 year you get if you deny. Since both you and your partner follow this "logic" and confess, you will both go to jail for 3 years. Doing what you believe is in your best interest leads <span>to </span>a worse outcome than if you cooperate and deny. But here is the dilemma. You don't know if you can trust your partner. Cooperation only works if you and your</p>
    <p class="calibre2">partner can trust each other.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Tests show that if people play the game over and over, they learn that it is more profitable <span>to </span>cooperate. Repetition tests trust. Trust is key and fragile. <span>It </span>can vanish in a moment. As the 19th Century American President Abraham Lincoln wrote: <span>"If </span>you once forfeit the confidence of your fellow citizens, you can never regain their respect and esteem."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Another way <span>to </span>create cooperation is to let the partners communicate during the game. Talking encourages cooperation. Since people are social animals, they may change their behavior to keep others goodwill. <span>In </span>the end, it's a matter of trust and giving individuals an incentive <span>to </span>cooperate.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">In chapter three of <span>The Descent of Man, </span>Charles Darwin wrote:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">At the moment of action, man will no doubt be apt to follow the stronger impulse; and though this may occasionally prompt him <span>to </span>the noblest deeds, it will far more commonly lead him <span>to </span>gratify his own desires at the expense of other men. But after their gratification, when past and weaker impressions are contrasted with the ever-enduring social instincts, retribution will surely come. Man will then feel dissatisfied with himself, and will resolve with more or less force to act differently for the future. This is conscience; for conscience looks backwards and judges past actions, inducing that kind of dissatisfaction, which if weak we call regret, and if severe remorse.</p>

This rewards past cooperation and punishes past defection. This assumes that the game is repeated time after time. In reality we never know if we meet our opponent again in the future. As long as neither our opponent nor we knows when the game ends, it pays to be nice. Of course, the game of the Prisoner's Dilemma is only a two-player game. Reality often involves many-person interactions.</a>

    <p class="calibre2">There is one group that scientists say we treat better than others - our close genetic relatives. This is kin selection. We act altruistic to our kin because they share our genes. Studies show that in all social species, relatives are more likely to help each other. The greater degree ofgenetic relatedness between two individuals, the more likely it is that an individual treats the other individual better. <span>If </span>you sacrifice something for your children, it may harm you but since your children share your genes, the overall effect is positive. Scientists say that one test of kin selection is what we would do if a relative and a good friend were both close to drowning. We can only save one of them. What if oneof them was adistant cousin that you'd seen only twice in your life and the friend was a person you spent every day with? Who would you save?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">What other behavior was appropriate for our ancestors?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">A tendency for fear</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Our fears are always more numerous than our dangers.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">- Lucius Annaeus Seneca (Roman philosopher, c.4 BC-65 AD)</p>
    <p class="calibre2">

    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">The passengers boarded flight 651 to Chicago. Two hours after takeoff, the flight attendant heard suspicious noise ftom the lavatory. The passengers started to talk among themselves. Panic erupted.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">We fear dramatic and threatening events. We fear the loss of our health, family, friends, security, money, social status, power, or jobs. We also fear violence, crime, punishment, rejection, failure, the unknown, the immediate, the unpredictable or the uncontrollable. Studies show that even witnessing a traumatic event can produce the same fear response as experiencing the event ourselves.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Fear is our most basic emotion. Fear has evolved to help us anticipate danger and avoid pain. As science writer Rush Dozier writes in <span>Fear Itself </span>"Fear is fundamental because life is fundamental. <span>If </span>we die, everything else becomes irrelevant."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Humans have developed a strong emotion for fear. Our ancestors environment was fraught with dangers. Fear of physical danger, social disapproval, lack of food,</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">24</p>
    <p class="calibre2">no mate, predators, etc. Self-survival was a powerful incentive. Mistakes could be extremely costly. Assume two individuals heard a strange sound behind the bushes. One of them looked behind the bushes, was bit by a poisonous snake and died. The other one saw what happened, ran away and survived. To always assume there was a threat behind the bushes and run away could save an individual's life. The cost of being wrong and running when there was no snake was minimal. But the cost of staying around when there was a snake could be life threatening. Failure to detect threats is often more costly than false alarms. Our ancestors learned through trial and error that in the long run, pain could be avoided if they were fearful. They survived the dangers because they learned how to respond.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">If <span>pain and pleasure are guides to the behavior that leads to survival and</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2">reproduction, fear is our biological warning signal for avoiding pain. Fear warns us of potential harm and keeps us from acting in self-destructive ways. <span>It </span>helps us avoid threats and makes us act to prevent further damage. Fear guides us to avoid what didn't work in the past. Fear causes worry and anxiety, a normal response to physical danger. <span>It </span>activates hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, which keeps us attentive to harm since we need full attention to escape from a threat.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">The degree of fear we feel depends on our interpretation of the threat and our perception of control. The more helpless and vulnerable we feel, the stronger our emotion for fear becomes.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Assume that you are walking alone late at night on a deserted street in New York City. Suddenly, you hear steps behind you. What happens? Immediately you fear the worst - robbery, assault, etc. Your autonomic nervous system takes over and prepares you for fight or flight. Your response begins in your brain and activates a biochemical process. Your heart rate, breathing, blood pressure, pulse and blood sugar increase. Normal behavior when you are the victim of stress, either perceived or real. You reacted with fear on the deserted street because evolution equipped your brain to register pain more sensitively than any other emotion. You were using the "memory" of your ancestral past - your primitive fear system of fight or flight.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">What we fear and the strength of our reaction depend on our genes, life experiences, and the specific situation. You may react instinctively at first, but if the situation is one that you've experienced before (since our brain is continuously being "rewired" with life experiences), the final reaction may be to calm down. You could turn around to find an old lady walking her dog. Or you may run away, because you avoid situations that in the past have been painful. The more we are exposed to a stimulus, even a terrifying one, the higher our</p>

Until something terrifying happened. Often our emotions provide affective information that helps us make better decisions. For example, guilt may make us regret doing wrong things, and correct them. <span>It </span>may also induce cooperation. Disgust seems to be a response to danger to protect us from disease or harm. Shame may help us avoid certain temptations or reduce the risk of group-conflict.

    <p class="calibre2">Seeking explanations</p>
    <p class="calibre2"><span>'1 </span><span>ate a plant and now I feel sick. Therefore, I believe the plant was not good for me. </span><span>" </span><span>In </span>chapter two of <span>The Descent of Man, </span>Charles Darwin wrote: <span>''As </span>soon as the important faculties of the imagination, wonder, and curiosity, together with some power of reasoning, had become partially developed, man would naturally have craved to understand what was passing around him."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">We don't like uncertainty or the unknown. We need to categorize, classify, organize, and structure the world. Categorizing ideas and objects helps us to recognize, differentiate and understand. It simplifies life. To understand and control our environment helps us to deal with the future. We want to know how and why things happen and what is going to happen in the future. To understand how an event happened helps us predict how it could happen again. This is why we always look for patterns and causal relationships among objects, actions, and situations. This makes it easier to identify and understand things and to make predictions based on similarities in patterns. Finding and recognizing connections between things and events in our environment helps us to learn what does and does not work. Patterns also give us comfort, making our need to find them even more important.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">To learn what works and does not and what is good or bad for us means we have to explore. Exploring our environment successfully enables our survival and reproduction.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Remembering places, facts and events is important. But sometimes, the brain seems particularly attracted to new information and novel experiences. Recent studies suggest that the brain responds to novelty. The unknown is potentially rewarding, thereby motivating us to explore our environment and learn for the future.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">We must be flexible in order to deal with constant change and unpredictability. We often explore the unknown in a random fashion. For example, many animals,</p>
    <p class="calibre2">26</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <a id="calibre_link-40">when foraging, start with a random search, and only change their behavior when they find a rewarding stimulus. Then they move towards it.</a>
      <a id="calibre_link-41">â</a>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Being flexible and learning a variety of options to choose from to deal with the world is of great value. This implies that finding new ways to deal with the world is superior to overtraining old patterns. For example, studies of honeybees show that they navigate according to a map-like organization of spatial memory. When bees are over-trained to find a single nectar site, it is easy for them to find their way back to the hive from that site, but not very well from other sites. But when the same bees are trained to many nectar sites, they are much better in finding their way home to the hive from a range of different locations. Further studies suggest that we learn better when we mix new information with what we already know.</p>

    <p class="calibre2">Making fast classifications</p>
    <p class="calibre2">There is a story about a man who went to visit a professor at his home. Outside the house a dog was playing on the lawn. When the professor opened the door to let the man in, the dog ran into the house. Later the professor asked the man, "Do you always travel with your dog?" The man replied, "It's not my dog. I thought it was yours."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Our brain is wired to perceive before it thinks - to use emotions before reason. <span>fu </span>a consequence of our tendency for fear, fast classifications come naturally. Limited time and knowledge in a dangerous and scarce environment made hasty generalizations and stereotyping vital for survival. Waiting and weighing evidence could mean death. Don't we often draw fast conclusions, act on impulse and use our emotions to form quick impressions and judgments?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">We are especially wary of things that move. They may imply danger. That is why we automatically assume agency - someone was responsible - when we detect motion. Better safe than sorry.</p>

    <p class="calibre2">Males and females have different priorities</p>
    <p class="calibre2">"What is the brain for?" asked Neuroscience Professor Michael Gazzaniga in <i class="calibre4">The </i><span>Mind's Past. </span>"The smart-aleck answer to the question is sex. Put more completely, the brain exists to make better decisions about how to enhance reproductive success." Reproduction is the central act in the life of every living thing. Once an individual has survived past the age of reproduction, the individual is evolutionarily useless.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">The struggle to reproduce can sometimes have peculiar effects. <span>In </span>nature, things are not always what they seem.</p>

    <p class="calibre2">An ant climbs to the top ofa grass stem, falls down and tries again and again... until a sheep comes along and eats the grass (and the ant}. WHY does the ant persist in climbing the grass? How does the ant benefit?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">There is no benefit to the ant. Its behavior was manipulated by a parasitic flatworm that needed to get into the gut of the sheep in order to reproduce. By commandeering its intermediate ant host to climb to the tips of the grass blades, the parasite increased the ant's chances of being eaten by a grazing animal. The benefit was to the reproductive success of the parasite, not the ant. Another parasite, Toxoplasma, can only reproduce within cats. It causes rats to lose their inherited fear of cats (cat scent) and thereby makes the rat more likely to end up as cat dinner. Another parasite causes fish to swim in shallow waters so birds can eat them, this parasite's final host.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Most animals (including humans) do something to attract the opposite sex. Since natural selection is ultimately about reproduction in a world of limited mates, some individuals were better at getting mates than others. The individuals that had an advantage in attracting prospective mates were "selected." What characteristics gave them the advantage? What anatomical features or behavioral traits attract the opposite sex or intimidate rivals?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Darwin realized that many anatomical and behavioral characteristics didn't have any survival value but could play an important role in attracting mates. Strength and beauty were such signals. He called this mechanism sexual selection. It has for example been shown that colors spark sexual interest among butterflies. And peahens prefer peacocks with big, colorful tails.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">In <span>Parental Investment and Sexual Selection, </span>biologist Robert Trivers says that</p>
    <p class="calibre2">the force behind sexual selection is parental investment, or "any investment by the parent in an individual offspring that increases the offspring's chance of surviving (and hence reproductive success) at the cost of the parent's ability to invest in other offspring."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Men need to attract women. But they also need to keep other men away from "their" woman. A woman must invest in each of her children. There is a nine month pregnancy and thereafter many years of child-caring. She invests time, energy and increases her chance of earlier death. There are limits to how many children she can produce during her lifetime. A man has less costs of reproduction. He can interact with many women and produce an enormous amount of children. He doesn't need to be around all the time. Many women can raise their children without help.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Since the goal of evolution is reproduction, a man should want to have sex with as many women as possible. This causes competition among men for women.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">28</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <a id="calibre_link-42">How does a man eliminate this competition? He can either make himself more attractive to the woman or he can eliminate or reduce the competition.</a>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">The reproductive success of women doesn't depend on how many men she has sex with, but on her ability to get access to resources (like food, shelter, and protection) for herself and her children. Women are therefore more discriminating than men. She won't pick the first guy around. This causes women to compete with each other for access to resources. A man that is perceived as wealthy and having status has an advantage. So mating choices (showing up as unconscious preferences) are influenced by the fact that women have more at stake than men do.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">In 1989, Psychology Professor David Buss published a study of thousands of men and women from 37 cultures around the world showing the ranking of qualities that are most important in choosing someone to date or marry. Women placed more emphasis on a potential mate's financial prospects. Women also preferred ambitious and industrious men. Women preferred older men. Men preferred younger women. Men ranked physical attractiveness higher than women did. The study also showed that a man felt most jealous when his woman was having sex with someone else. A woman felt most jealous when her man became emotionally attached to someone else.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Studies show other differences between the sexes. Women are less inclined to take risks. They are more influenced by the chance of loss. They are less competitive and status-conscious. Other studies show that men and women differ in their behavioral and cognitive capabilities. Some of this reflects varying hormonal influences on brain development. Like most things, this is context dependent.</p>

    <p class="calibre2">Isn't it likely that a good reputation, status, resources and being socially accepted helped our ancestors survive, get a mate, and reproduce?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">In a small hunter-gatherer society, what was good for the group often paid off for the individual. Cooperation was critical in an environment with limited resources, individual weaknesses and many dangers. Isolation from a group or society could mean destruction. There was safety in numbers. The group protected the individual against predators, hunted together, exchanged</p>

    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">29</p>
    <p class="calibre2">information about where food was, cooperated to defend food from enemies, and was a key resource for mates and help with infants. Together the group stood a greater chance of survival.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">If we help another member of the small society, he may help us when we need it. If he doesn't, we may never help him again. This behavior is called reciprocation</p>
    <p class="calibre2">- the idea of "I scratch your back and you scratch mine." A reputation for being reliable and trustworthy is important because how we acted in the past is the only guide to how we act in the future. Ifwe fool someone, he tells his friends, destroying our future possibilities for cooperation with others. Isn't that why we trust our friends but are careful when we meet strangers whom we know nothing about?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">We have a strong concern for fairness. We get upset when things are unfair. We sometimes even punish others at a cost to ourselves. Maybe we don't want to appear weak or easily taken advantage <span>0Â£ </span>Since we evolved in small communities with repeated interactions, it made sense to build up a reputation for not appearing weak. We wanted to encourage people to treat us better the next time around.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">What happens if we help someone but the next time we need help, this person conveniently disappears? What about people who don't return favors? True reciprocity only works if (1) we live in the same small society so we recognize each other, can keep track of "services" given and received, and have future opportunities to interact, and (2) the cost of the act is pretty much the same as the future favor the recipient receives. One-shot encounters encourage selfishness as told by Biology Professor Lee Alan Dugatkin:</p>

    <p class="calibre2">Traits like fear of failure, losing social status or reputation were important because they affected an individual's standing in the ancestral hunter-gatherer society. Access <span>to </span>food and sex depended on it. Survival and reproduction could be threatened. Social punishment was dangerous. It could lead to exile. According to Human Ecology Professor Garrett Hardin, it is the same today:</p>

    <p class="calibre2">Fear of disapproval is the major force that keeps a society intact: fear of God, fear of the police, and fear of the judgment of neighbors. Religious authorities want the fear of God</p>
    <p class="calibre2">to <span>be the predominant controller. Civil authorities want fear of police and court </span>to</p>

    <p class="calibre2">As we saw earlier there is competition among men for women. Women compete with each other for access to resources.Women wanted males who could take care of the children. Resources like food, lodging, and status attracted them. Striving for authority, dominance, esteem, position,  and respect were advertisements for wealth. Charles Darwin said: "Man admires and often tries to exaggerate whatever characteristics nature may have given him."</p>

Another study showed that men who were socially isolated were more likely to die than more socially integrated people were. It has also been shown that social rejection feels similar to physical pain. Rejection hurts!</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Pecking order also matters. <span>As </span>we strive for status, hierarchies emerge.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Norwegian zoologist Thorleif Schjelderup-Ebbe discovered that in the world of hens there is a linear hierarchy where every hen knows its place. Science writer Robert Wright says in The Moral Animal: "Throw a bunch of hens together, and, after a time of turmoil, including much combat, things will settle down. Disputes...will now be brief and decisive, as one hen simply pecks the other, bringing quick deferral."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">The pecking order determines who gets the first chance <span>to </span>eat, and which hen can peck the other hens.Each hen knows who it can dominate, and in turn, who will dominate it.</p>

    <p class="calibre2"><a id="calibre_link-43">Status hierarchies aren't only valid for hens. Studies show that when we put a group of children together, they will shortly fall into separate grades. The ones at the top are best liked, most often imitated, and most obeyed. </a><span>It </span>is painful to lose status once it has been obtained.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Studies show that where we stand on the social ladder influences our health, well-being and length of life. The higher our status in the pecking order, the healthier we are likely to be.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">We must be careful not to carry these evolutionary explanations about adaptive behavior too far. There are many causes for behavior. We can't extrapolate the conditions of the ancestral environment to explain every behavior. No one knows what the ancestral environment was like. Unlike bone and tissue, there is no fossil evidence of behavior. Neither is there any neurological or genetic evidence for or against certain behavior. And evolutionary explanations about the brain can't be experimentally tested. A trait that is found everywhere isn't necessarily genetically specified. But much of the behavior described is consistent with evidence we have from other organisms and documented human history.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Let's go back one million years and assume you were living in a small community with 150 people where everybody knew each other, and where the mating opportunities were limited. The environment was fraught with danger and challenges. The key was to avoid danger, get food and attract a partner. What behavior was critical to survival and reproduction?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Isn't it rewarding to make fast judgments?- <span>"If </span>noise behind the bush, then run." <span>It </span>is a natural tendency to act on impulse - to use emotions before reason. The behavior that was critical for survival and reproduction in our evolutionary history still applies today. Wouldn't being fearful help you survive? Social failure be costly? Maintaining status, resources and social approval help you survive and get a mate? Wouldn't you present yourself as honest, nice and trustworthy so others will cooperate with you? Wouldn't a common threat or a common goal make people cooperate? Wouldn't following social norms make sense? Wouldn't you have a strong aversion to losses and only take big risks when you were threatened? Wouldn't you be concerned with the short-term interest of yourself and loved ones?</p>

    <p class="calibre2">Much of our psychology is the result of cultural influences</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Human society is not only shaped by the evolution of genes, but also by cultural evolution. Practices, methods, tools, myths, ethics, and social norms that are important in the evolution of our behavior. Customs that we learn from the experience of our parents and others - either by teaching or observation.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">

    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">32</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <a id="calibre_link-44">Cultural evolution is faster than genetic evolution since it allows much of what we learn to be passed on and combined with what others around us have learned. Unlike biological evolution, cultural evolution is not inherited. We don't inherit our parents' habits. We learn from them.</a>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">In a sense, genetic and cultural evolution interact. Biology influences our culture. Take language as an example. We come equipped with an anatomy, physiology and biochemistry that give us the ability to learn a language. But we are not born with a language. The language we speak is a product of our culture. Our culture also influences our biology by creating the environment in which natural selection is tested. <span>If </span>a certain behavior proves to be beneficial generation over generation, that behavior is favored by natural selection. Assume individuals over time make certain social behavior choices. These choices were transmitted through learning and culture. Over time, they will be favored by natural selection</p>
    <p class="calibre2">since they positively influence survival and reproduction.</p>

      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">What is our basic nature?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Our nature is a product of our biological and cultural history. Evolution explains how we are shaped and biologically constrained. Like our bones, kidney, eyes, and legs, our brain has been shaped by natural selection. Natural selection equipped us with traits that increase our chances for survival and reproduction. <span>It  </span>then follows that we consciously or unconsciously behave according to what we perceive is in our own best interest. This is our biological base nature. <span>It </span>is strengthened or weakened depending on our life experiences. <span>If </span>we assume that people on average act out of self-interest we'll be less disappointed than if we assume that people on average act out of altruism. This does not mean that we can't make things better. But doing so demands that we first understand why we are the way we are. Richard Dawkins said in <span>The Selfish Gene: </span>"Be warned that if you wish, as I do, to build a society in which individuals cooperate generously and unselfishly towards a common good, you can expect little help from biological nature. Let us try to teach generosity and altruism, because we are born selfish."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Let's summarize the forces that influence and set the limits for our judgments. <span>Genes- </span>environmental stimuli cause response tendencies from our genes. Our genes have evolved and their functions are primarily based on what was beneficial in the hunter-gatherer environment - the environment where humans spent</p>

    <p class="calibre2">
      <a id="calibre_link-45">most of their time. To survive, we must avoid all perceived threats to our survival and reproduction. Evolution has developed a value system based on pain and pleasure that help us deal with the environment. Since the ancestral environment consisted oflimited resources and danger, we developed a strong aversion for loss and a tendency for fear. We made fast evaluations and became social animals. We were predisposed to evaluate situations by being fearful. To not respond with fear could be more costly than responding with fear and being wrong. We also acted in ways where the reward was important and the cost was minimal.</a>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Life experiences <span>- </span><span>upbringing, nutrition, education, social stamping, physical,</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2">social and cultural settings create certain convictions, habits, values, attitudes and character traits. This in turn creates our individual beliefs and assumptions. Our judgments are influenced by our state of mind.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Present environment <span>- </span><span>outside factors like the environment, the context or circumstances, or the specific situation.</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2">Randomness <span>- </span><span>we are prepared to be open minded to new experiences since environments vary; handling new challenges is a means of adaptation.</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2">The consequences of our actions reinforce certain behavior. <span>If </span>the consequences were rewarding, our behavior is likely to be repeated. What we consider rewarding is individual specific. Rewards can be anything from health, money, job, reputation, family, status, or power. In all of these activities, we do what works. This is how we adapt. The environment selects our future behavior. But it's not just what happens to us that counts. It's what we think happens.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">When we face a situation, our brains create an expectation. We can act in ways contrary to our self-interest if we don't understand the consequences.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Our behavior creates feedback from our environment. <span>If </span>we do dumb things and suffer the consequences, we may still do dumb things in the future even if it causes pain. Either because we don't understand the cause of our mistake, or the pain is less painful than other behavior.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Our experiences are stored in the brain and influence us in the future. New connecting patterns between neurons are created.</p>

    <p class="calibre2">If <span>we often act out of self-interest, why do we make decisions that are clearly not in our best interests?</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2">There is a disconnect between the ancestral world to which our brains adapted and today's world. Many of our traits are better adapted for the demands of the ancestral world such as: keeping away from predators, risking social exclusion, finding mates, getting enough food, maintaining relationships, acquiring status and a safe place <span>to </span>live, and bearing children.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Genetic and cultural evolution equipped us with behavioral tendencies (like the tendency for fear, reciprocal cooperation, fast classifications, concern for social approval, etc.) that help us interact with our environment. These tendencies are on average more helpful than not (otherwise we wouldn't be here today). Sometimes they lead us astray and cause us to make misjudgments.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">For example, we may be biased by our automatic tendency to trust the people we like. Liking is often based on first impressions. We are superbly equipped to read other people for signs of trustworthiness. We look at their emotional state - their voice and general expression. However, it is often difficult <span>to </span>spot the difference between a good and bad actor. <span>An </span>individual may be secretive and hostile, or warm and open. What consequences would these different behaviors have on our perception of that individual? We forget to think about other factors that are important in evaluating a person or a situation. Appearances may be deceiving. The best con artists always behave as though they are not acting in their best interest. The 16th Century Italian political philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli said in <span>The Prince: </span>"Princes who have achieved great things have been those who have given their word lightly, who have known how <span>to </span>trick men with their cunning, and who, in the end, have overcome those abiding by honest principles."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">In Part One we have learned about our nature and our limitations. With this background let us now look at how our psychological abilities affect our decision making.</p>

    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">It's ego. It's greed. It's envy. It's fear. It's mindless imitation of other people. I mean, there are a variety of factors that cause that horsepower of the mind <span>to </span>get diminished dramatically before the output turns out. And I would say if Charlie and I have any advantage it's not because we're so smart, it is because we're rational and we very seldom let extraneous factors interfere with our thoughts.

    <p class="calibre2">interfere with it... we try to get fearful when others are greedy. We try to get greedy when others are fearful. We try to avoid any kind of imitation of other people's behavior. And those are the factors that cause smart people to get bad results.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">I always look at IQ and talent as representing the horsepower of the motor, but then in terms of the output, the efficiency with which the motor works, depends on rationality. That's because a lot of people start out with 400-horsepower motors and get a hundred horsepower of output. It's way better to have a 200-horsepower motor and get it all into output. So why do smart people do things that interfere with getting the output they're entitled to? It gets into the habits, and character and temperament, and it really gets into behaving in a rational manner. Not getting in your own way.</p>

    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Part One gave us a background of our behavior, psychology and limitations. We learned how pain and pleasure guide our behavior, how we tend to take the most rewarding view of events, how we make quick judgments, and are social animals. We also saw how we have developed a strong aversion to loss and uncertainty, and how it is natural for people to behave in ways they perceive is in their best interests. Charles Munger says, <span>"If </span>you want <span>to </span>avoid irrationality, it helps to understand the quirks in your own mental wiring and then you can take appropriate precautions." This part explores 28 reasons for misjudgments that can be explained by our psychological make-up. Many of the reasons are rooted in psychological tendencies and biases that often influence us subconsciously. The more emotional, confused, uncertain, insecure, excited, distracted, tired or</p>
    <p class="calibre2">stressed we are, the easier we make mistakes. Geniuses aren't excluded.</p>

    <p class="calibre2">These psychological tendencies (that also interact) have been verified by a number of experiments. Some people are more vulnerable <span>to </span>them than others. But we can't study them independent of an individual's values and the situation. Behavior that seems irrational may be fully rational from the individual's point of view. There is always some background within which behavior makes sense. Behavior can't be seen as rational or irrational independent of context. We are created with a series of emotions that are appropriate depending on</p>
    <p class="calibre2">circumstances. <span>If </span>we change context or environment, we change behavior.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">The next chapter describes the 28 psychological reasons why we make misjudgments and mistakes. Observe that these biases and tendencies are often not independent of one another. There is some overlap. Observe also that there are many reasons for a given behavior. Many of the real-world illustrations can be explained by more than one tendency and also by non-psychological factors. Misjudgments are often caused by many factors working together.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Most of the explanations are based on work done by Charles Munger, Psychology Professor Robert Cialdini, Behavioral Science and Economics Professor Richard Thaler, Psychology Professor Robyn Dawes, Psychology Professor Daniel Gilbert, and Psychology Professors Daniel Kahneman and the late Amos Tversky.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">The Russian scientist Ivan Pavlov studied the digestive system of dogs when he observed that a stimulus unrelated to food made the dogs salivate. <span>In </span>one experiment he rang a bell just before giving food to the dog. He repeated this several times until the dog salivated at the sound of the bell alone. No sight or smell of food was present. The sound of the bell produced the same response as the food. The dog learned to associate the bell with food.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Experiments have shown that we can learn to fear a harmless stimulus if it is paired with an unpleasant one. <span>If </span>for example rats consistently receive mild electrical shock after hearing a tone, the rats learn to develop a fear of the tone alone. Association can influence the immune system. One experiment studied food aversion in mice. Mice got saccharin-flavored water (saccharin has incentive value due to its sweet taste) along with a nausea-producing drug. Would the mice show signs of nausea the next time they got saccharin water alone? Yes, but the mice also</p>

The mere pairing of the saccharin with the drug caused the mouse immune system to learn the association. Therefore, every time the mouse encountered the saccharin, its immune system weakened making the mouse vulnerable to infections.</a>

Many times we buy products, enter relationships, and invest our money merely because we associate them with positive things. No wonder advertisers or politicians connect what they want to sell with things we like and avoid associating themselves with negative events. Pair a sports car with something that produces a positive feeling- a beautiful and sexy model - and we automatically associate the car with pleasure.</span></p>

        <p class="calibre2">Whether we like someone is influenced by the events with which an individual is associated. Bad news isn't welcome. We tend to dislike people who tell us what we don't want to hear even when they didn't cause the bad news i.e., kill the messenger. This gives people an incentive to avoid giving bad news. To protect themselves, they tell the news in a way they believe we want to hear it. This tendency is called the Persian Messenger Syndrome and traces its origins back to ancient Greece. <span>In </span><span>Antigone, </span>a messenger feared for his life since he knew the king would be unhappy with the news he brought.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Warren Buffett says on being informed of bad news: "We only give a couple of instructions to people when they go to work for us: One is to think like an owner.

            <p class="calibre2"><i class="calibre4">john's actions brought him praise and money, making him continue his behavior. </i>We do what is rewarding and avoid what we are punished for. We learn - right and wrong- from the consequences of our actions. Whatever causes us to repeat a certain behavior is reinforcing and whatever makes us stop is punishing. Behavior that is rewarding or feels pleasurable tends to be repeated. We don't continue doing what we're being punished for. Give people what they desire (or take away something undesirable) and their behavior will repeat. Give them something undesirable (or take away what they desire) and their behavior will stop. <span>In </span>the beginning, rewarding (or punishing) people is most effective when it is administered without delay and each time the behavior is repeated.</p>
            <p class="calibre2">Once a behavior becomes learned, variable rewards strengthen the behavior. Behavior that is rewarded on an unpredictable basis has the highest rate of response and is the most difficult to extinguish. This is, for example, how gamblers are rewarded. When they don't know when the reward will arrive, they try again and again. Furthermore, the greater the reward, the more resistant the behavior is to extinction.</p>
            <p class="calibre2">We base what is rewarding or punishing on our associations to past experiences and their consequences or with values or preferences we are born with.</p>
            <p class="calibre2">An action that is reinforced becomes stronger over time. This is how habits, superstitions and addictions are created. Both are hard to change. As the great 18th Century English writer Samuel Johnson said: "The chains of habit are too weak to be felt until they are too strong to be broken."</p>

            <p class="calibre2">Studies in Sweden show that changes in the sickness insurance system affect sick leave behavior. Reforms implying more generous compensation for sick leave tenq to be associated with permanent increases in total sick leave per person employed. Other studies from the U.S. regarding health services have shown that in cases where someone else picks up the costs, patients tend to over-consume the health services.</p>
            <p class="calibre2">Why do people abuse the health care and welfare system? Isn't it natural that people use the system if they don't have to pay anything? And if people don't have to pay for a benefit, they often overuse it. The more people that benefit from misusing the system, the less likely it is that anyone will draw attention to what really happens. Individually they get a large benefit and it's a small loss for society. Until everyone starts thinking the same. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle said: "That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own; they care less for what is common.<span>"</span></p>

            <p class="calibre2">Why do people steal?</p>
            <p class="calibre2">Studies show that 23% of people say they would steal if they couldn't get caught. <span>It </span>is estimated that U.S. businesses lose $400 billion a year from fraud and about a third of that is from employees stealing from their employer. Why? Opportunity and reward. In Charles Munger's words: ''The worst abuses come where people have the greatest temptations." <span>If </span>we make it easy for people to steal, they steal (and bad behavior will spread).</p>

The pigeons continued with the behavior that worked - every time they performed the behavior, food appeared. But food appeared independent of what the pigeons did. Skinner wrote in <span>"Superstition" in the pigeon: </span>"There are many analogies in human behavior... A few accidental connections between a ritual and favorable consequences suffice to set up and maintain the behavior in spite of many nonreinforced instances."</p>

And it was always screwed up. They could never get it done on time.</p>
            <p class="calibre2">They tried everything- moral suasion, threats, you name it. And nothing worked. Finally, somebody got the idea to pay all these people not so much an <i class="calibre4">hour, </i>but so much a <i class="calibre4">shift </i>and when it's all done, they can all go home.

            <p class="calibre2">john invested in a biotech start-up that went sour and he lost money.</p>
            <p class="calibre2">After a success, we become overly optimistic risk-takers. After a failure, we become overly pessimistic and risk-averse - even in cases where success or failure was merely a result of chance. Good consequences don't necessarily mean we made a good decision, and bad consequences don't necessarily mean we made a bad decision.</p>
            <p class="calibre2">The next time someone presents John an investment opportunity in a biotech start-up the chances are he will decline. He associates the new proposal to his earlier experience. And since people tend to believe that the future mirrors the past, he declines. But what happens if John's first investment made him a lot of money? Wouldn't John associate the new proposal to his old pleasurable experience? Isn't he therefore more likely to invest? This automatic association to what worked in the past causes people to under-react to new conditions and circumstances.</p>

            <p class="calibre2">Mark Twain understood the dangers of blindly trusting past experience for dealing with the future. "We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom in it, and stop there, lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hot stove-lid. She will not sit down on a hot stove-lid again - but also she will never sit down on a cold one anymore."</p>

            <p class="calibre2">Mary never wraps the kids Christmas presents in one box.</p>
            <p class="calibre2">Since our experiences seem longer when broken into segments, we like to have pleasurable experiences broken into segments but painful ones combined. That is why Mary puts presents in many boxes. Frequent rewards feel better. For example, it feels better to gain <span>$</span>50 twice than $100 once since every gain is rewarding. It feels better to lose $100 once than $50 twice since every loss is painful.</p>
            <p class="calibre2">We prefer a sequence of experiences that improve over time. Losing $100 first and then gaining $50 seems more rewarding than gaining $50 and then losing</p>
            <p class="calibre2">$100. We want to get rid of the bad experiences first. Immediate losses are preferred over delayed ones. Just as we don't like bad experiences, we also don't like waiting for them. We like to get over them fast.</p>
            <p class="calibre2">Mere association and reinforcement are both examples of conditioned reflexes. Charles Munger gives an example how these forces can be used as he describes the invention of non-alcoholic drinks:</p>
            <p class="calibre2">

            </p>
            <p class="calibre2">The food value and so forth of the beverage is the <span>reinforcer. </span>And the trade dress, trade name and look of the beverage is the <span>stimulant...</span></p>
            <p class="calibre2">Then, you go on to the second kind of conditioned reflex- and that's straight Pavlov... Well, how do you <span>get </span>Pavlovian mere-association effects? Obviously, you <span>associate </span>this beverage and its trademarks with every good thing that people like generally: exalting events, sex objects, happy times - you name it.</p>
            <p class="calibre2">
              <br class="calibre_rescale_" />

            </p>
            <p class="calibre2">Well, the customer tries something else and discovers that <span>it's </span>a big reinforcer. So he shifts brands. We know, in matrimony, that if you're always <span>available, </span>the spouse is less likely to shift brands. And people don't tend to organize marriage to include permanent long separations. Similarly, if you're selling a product and it's always available, people are less likely to shift to some other product and get reinforced by it.</p>

Since people do what works, be sure to make the incentives right. Tie incentives to performance and to the factors that determine the result you want to achieve. Make people share both the upside and downside. And make them understand the link between their performance, their reward and what you finally want to accomplish. For example, tie a manager's compensation to gain in business value (of the unit under his control) minus a cost factor for capital that is used to produce this value. The auto insurer GEICO's plan exemplifies Berkshire Hathaways's incentive compensation principles. Warren Buffett says:</p>

A reward for our achievements makes us feel that we are good at something thereby increasing our motivation. But a reward that feels controlling and makes us feel that we are only doing it because we're paid to do it, decreases the appeal.

For example, when the first Dead Sea scrolls were discovered and the archeologists wanted more fragments of the scrolls to be found, they offered a reward per fragment. The result: the fragments were split into smaller pieces before they were turned in.</p>

We are biased by our incentives as are others including lawyers, accountants, doctors, consultants, salesmen, organizations, the media, etc. What is good for them may not be good for us. Advisors are paid salesmen and may trick us into buying what we don't need.</p>
            <p class="calibre2">For an attorney, litigation is often more lucrative than settlement. Lawyer William <span>F. </span>Coyne, Jr. says in <span>The Case for Settlement Counsel </span>there are "significant incentives for lawyers not to embrace early settlement ... These incentives include the need to market services, the desire not to appear weak, the obligation to represent a client zealously, the thirst for justice, but perhaps not least, the desire to maximize income."</p>
            <p class="calibre2">Warren Buffett tells us that one of Berkshire's compensation arrangements was worked out: "without the "help" of lawyers or compensation consultants. This arrangement embodies a few very simple ideas - not the kind of terms favored by consultants who cannot easily send a large bill unless they have established that you have a large problem (and one, of course, that requires an annual review)."</p>

            <p class="calibre2">Let's look at the brokerage and investment banking business. Brokers have a strong incentive to get us to trade. They advise us what to buy and sell. Volume creates commissions. Investment bankers encourage overpriced acquisitions to generate fees. Investment bankers have every incentive to get initial public offerings (IPO) deals done, regardless of the company's quality. Their compensation is tied to the revenues the deal brings in. Analysts are rewarded for helping sell the IPO. Brokers want to move the stock. What did Groucho Marx say? "I made a killing on Wall Street a few years ago.. <span>.I </span>shot my broker."</p>

            <p class="calibre2">Why do bankers approve risky loans?</p>
            <p class="calibre2">People who are rewarded for doing stupid things continue to do them. From their frame of reference, they acted logically based on how they were rewarded. The incentive system paid them to do the wrong thing. So if market share rather than profits pay a banker, he will write as many loans as possible. He is being rewarded every year while the net consequences of the bad loans won't be realized for a long time.</p>
            <p class="calibre2">Charles Munger gives an example of how Lloyd's Insurance rewarded their people:</p>
            <p class="calibre2">
              <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
            </p>
            <p class="calibre2">They were paid a percentage of the gross volume that went through. And paying everybody a percentage of the gross, when what you're really interested in is the net, is a system - given the natural bias of human beings toward doing what's in their own interest even though it has terrible consequences for other people - that really did Lloyd's in.</p>

            <p class="calibre2">Why do people give a biased picture of reality? Why do they make figures look better than they are or fake data to support something? Behavior that is not acceptable but results from the tendency of people doing what they perceive is in their best interest.</p>
            <p class="calibre2">There may be powerful economic and prestige-related incentives to underestimate costs and overestimate benefits when people try to sell projects. For example, studies based on data from several hundred large transportation infrastructure projects in twenty nations and five continents found evidence that in a number of cases, project promoters and forecasters of billion-dollar projects intentionally misrepresented the costs, benefits and risks of projects in order <span>to </span>get them approved.</p>
            <p class="calibre2">Charles Munger says that projections should be handled with care:</p>

            <p class="calibre2">Mark Twain used to say, "A mine is a hole in the ground with a liar on the top." And a projection prepared by anybody who stands to earn a commission or an executive trying to justify a particular course of action will frequently be a lie - although it's not a <span>deliberate </span>lie in most cases. The man has come to believe it himself. And that's the worst kind. Projections should be handled with great care - particularly when they're being provided by someone who has an interest in misleading you."</p>

            </p>
            <p class="calibre2">I have no use whatsoever for projections or forecasts. They create an illusion of apparent precision. The more meticulous they are, the more concerned you should be. We never look at projections, but we care very much about, and look very deeply at, track records. <span>If </span>a company has a lousy track record, but a very bright future, we will miss the opportuniry... I do not understand why any buyer of a business looks at a bunch of projections put together by a seller or his agent. You can almost say that it's <span>naive </span>to think that those</p>
            <p class="calibre2">projections have <span>any </span>utiliry whatsoever. We're just not interested.</p>

            <p class="calibre2">If <span>we don't have some idea ourselves of what the future is, to sit there and listen to some other guy who's trying to sell us the business or get a commission on it tell us what the future's going to be - like I say, it's very naive.</span></p>

            </p>
            <p class="calibre2">When they make these offerings, investment bankers display their humorous side: They dispense income and balance sheet projections extending five or more years into the future for companies they barely had heard of a few months earlier. <span>If </span>you are shown such schedules, I suggest that you join in the fun: Ask the investment banker for the <span>one-year </span>budgets that his own firm prepared as the last few years began and then compare these with what actually happened.</p>

            <p class="calibre2">The consultant to TransCorp was hired and paid by the company to advise the CEO on how he should be paid. <span>"If </span>I tell the CEO what he wants to hear, he will pay me well, rehire me and recommend me to other CEOs.

            <p class="calibre2">How do we act as an employee? <span>If </span>our boss wants a particular answer, do we give it? To quote the German proverb: "Whose bread I eat, his song I sing." Warren Buffett says:</p>

              <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
            </p>
            <p class="calibre2">I would say that the typical corporate organization is structured so that the CEOs opinions, biases and previous beliefs are reinforced in every possible way. Staffs won't give you any contrary recommendations - they'll just come back with whatever the CEO wants. And the Board of Directors won't act as a check, so the CEO pretty much gets what he wants.</p>

            <p class="calibre2">How can we change people? Benjamin Franklin said: "Would you persuade, speak of interest not of reason." Since the risk of losing is more motivating than the chance of gaining, we stand a better chance changing people if we appeal to their fear oflosing something they value - job, reputation, status, money, control, etc.</p>
            <p class="calibre2">It is often better <span>to </span>avoid situations where we need <span>to </span>change people. Changing people is hard as Warren Buffett says, "I'd say that the history that Charlie and I have had of persuading decent, intelligent people who we thought were doing unintelligent things <span>to </span>change their course of action has been <span>poor.</span><span>. . </span>When</p>

            <p class="calibre2">Changing people affects their motivation, feelings of responsibility, and tendency <span>to </span>reciprocate. <span>It </span>is better when people act out of their own free will. Warren Buffett illustrates:</p>

            </p>
            <p class="calibre2">We want the manager of each subsidiary to run their business in the way they think is best for their operation we'll never tell a subsidiary manager which vendor to patronize or</p>
            <p class="calibre2">anything of that sort. Once we start making those decisions for our managers, <i class="calibre4">we </i>become responsible for the operation and <span>they're </span>no longer responsible for the operation. And they're responsible for their operations. That means that they get <span>to </span>make the call, that it's up to them to do what's best for their subsidiary and that it's up <span>to </span>any other company that wants to do business with their operation <span>to </span>prove to them <span>why </span>it's best That's the</p>
            <p class="calibre2">Berkshire approach. I think, on balance, our managers <span>like </span>it that way - because they're</p>

            <p class="calibre2">What tends to inflate the price that CEO's pay for acquisitions? Studies found evidence of infection through three sources of hubris: 1) overconfidence after recent success, 2) a sense of self-importance; the belief that a high salary compared to other senior ranking executives imply skill, and 3) the CEO's belief in their own press coverage. The media tend to glorify the CEO and over-attribute business success to the role of the CEO rather than to other factors and people. This makes CEO's more likely to become both more overconfident about their abilities and more committed to the actions that made them media celebrities.</p>

            <p class="calibre2">When using advisers and if something turns out well, we take the credit, assigning the outcome to our skill. But if something turns out bad, we blame the advisor.</p>

And the house counsel there was an Irishman who was very outspoken and had a fair amount of charm. And he was highly regarded. So he could get by with talking frankly. And the whole group was toasting one another: "Aren't we great people for having done this great thing?" and this Irish house counsel raised his glass and said "Well, I'd like to toast the man who really caused our triumph." He said, "Here's to King Faisal ... Every calculation we made was off by 200%. All the costs were way higher, and the difficulties way greater than we ever conceived. All the predictions we made were totally asinine and wouldn't have worked with the oil prices we projected. But along came King Faisal and the oil cartel and raised the price of oil so high that they made us all look good. Let's honor the proper man here tonight. "</p>

They make us first agree to a small request, so small that no one would refuse. This way they create a commitment. Then they make a second and larger request (the one they wanted all along). We are then more likely to comply. This "foot-in-the-door technique" is based on the principle that if people ask us to make a small commitment, we are more likely to agree to a larger request because we want to appear consistent. One study showed that 76% of a group of homeowners agreed to put a large billboard on their front lawn, saying "Drive Carefully." Two weeks earlier, the homeowners had been approached by other researchers, asking them to place a tiny sign saying "Be a Safe driver" on their car windows. They now saw themselves as concerned citizens and people who care enough about driver safety to take a stand. They also believed that was how other people saw them.

Merely because you've spent money or time on some project or investment doesn't mean you must continue to spend it in the future. Time, effort, and money spent are gone. Decisions should be based on where you want to be. Not where you've been. Base decisions on the present situation and future consequences. What happened in the past may be a guide for estimating how likely something is to happen in the future. Ask: What do I want to achieve? What causes that?

One of my favorite stories, relevant to this story, involves a town in the South. There was this huge grocery store owned by one of the great national chains.

For example, people are likely to fight a restrictive law that takes away a benefit they have enjoyed for a long time.

We even put a higher value on the things we already own than we are willing to pay for the same things if we didn't own them (giving them up feels like a loss). This is why many companies offer money-back guarantees on their products. Once we have taken possession of some item, we are not likely to return it.</p>
                <p class="calibre2">Charles Munger says, "The deprival super-reaction syndrome of man helps cause much ruin as people's cognition is distorted as a result of their suffering losses and seeing near misses." We hate to sell losing stocks. It is the same as admitting to others and ourselves that we've made a mistake. We therefore hold on to our losers too long and sell our winners too soon. A realized loss feels worse than suffering the same loss on paper. The pain of feeling responsible for making a bad decision also plays a role (regret). The stock may bounce back after we've sold. And the more money and effort we've put in, the harder it is to let it go.</p>
                <p class="calibre2">We also feel that losing the opportunity to make money is less painful than losing the same amount of money. But a lost opportunity of making $100 has the same value as a real loss of $100.</p>

    <p class="calibre2">We are impatient in the short run and patient in the far away future. Studies show that we tend to become less patient when rewards are more immediate. Our discount rates (the values we assign to something) are higher in the short run than in the long run. For example, when a small reward is due tomorrow and a larger reward is due in one year, people often prefer the small immediate reward. But when the small reward is due in one year and the larger reward in two years, people tend to prefer the larger long-term reward. Studies show that one explanation for this is that outcomes occurring in the future are perceived as less certain.</p>

                <p class="calibre2">pair of psychology professors found the answer. No one had helped <i class="calibre4">just </i>because thirty-eight witnesses were present. A bystander to an emergency is unlikely to help when there are other people around. Why? They saw two reasons for this.</p>
                <p class="calibre2">First, we must interpret an event as an emergency. When we are uncertain, we have a tendency to look at people around us to see how they react. <span>If </span>others don't react, we interpret that as evidence that it is not an emergency, and we therefore don't react. We don't want to be the ones that stand out in a crowd and risk embarrassment for acting in a non-emergency situation. But here comes the problem. <span>If </span>each person reasons the same way, everyone draws the same conclusion. <span>"Since nobody is concerned, nothing is wrong. It can't bean emergency." </span>This is called pluralistic ignorance.</p>
                <p class="calibre2">The second reason is called diffusion of responsibility. The more people there are, the less personal responsibility we feel. We often rationalize by saying, <span>"Someone else probably called the police. </span><span>"If </span>we all think that way, no one will help. The more people we see around us, the less likely we are to help. We can't force people to help. <span>If </span>we punish people for not helping in an emergency, we will only create an incentive for people to avoid the punishment by not getting involved.</p>
                <p class="calibre2">This will cause them to interpret a situation as a non-emergency.</p>
                <p class="calibre2">So, how should we act if we are involved in an accident in a public place and need help? We should be specific. "You there, in the blue shirt. This is an emergency. Please help me!"</p>

In 1978, an American congressman and three others went on a fact-finding mission </a><span>to </span>Jonestown and were murdered. Jim Jones thought that he would be implicated in the killings and that the isolation ofJonestown would result in the end of the cult.

The participants in the experiment were instructed to shock another person if they answered a question wrong. No real pain was delivered during the experiment. But it showed that when we are given orders from what we believe to be a legitimate authority, we obey even if the result is that we end up hurting others. In later studies Milgram showed that obedience was maximized by first observing peers obey but dramatically reduced when peers rebelled, or when the victim acted like a masochist asking to be shocked. Milgram said in <span>Obedience to Authority: </span>"It is psychologically easy to ignore responsibility when one is only an immediate link in a chain of evil action."</p>

What key factors influence product failures?</p>
                <p class="calibre2"><span>"It </span>is easy to be wise after the event, "says Sherlock Holmes in <span>The Problem of Thor Bridge. </span>We read the present into the past. After an event, we know how things turned out. When trying to make sense of what has happened, we construct a plausible story or explanation that fits the outcome. But there are many ways an event or behavior can later be understood. There may be many contributing factors that <span>fit </span>the outcome, chance may be involved, or our guessed causes may also be consistent with other outcomes, including the opposite or prevention of the outcome. Ask: Could our explanation of the event help us predict future similar events?</p>
                <p class="calibre2">This is the danger of relying on case-based stories. Stories may be selected to prove something and may give us a delusional sense of clarity. Knowledge about outcomes may also cast some doubt on reconstructions of historical events (given that the historian was not there).

We don't know what uncertainties, conditions, or situational factors faced the decision-maker. Good decision-making can lead to bad outcomes and vice versa. <span>If </span>we believe that we predicted the past better than we did, we may also believe that we can predict the future better than we can.

Similar studies showed that rats or pigeons instead chose</p>
                <p class="calibre2">the alternative that came up most frequently. <span>If </span>we assume that a red light occurs</p>
                <p class="calibre2">with a frequency of 80% and a green light with a frequency of 20%, we should bet on the most likely outcome every time: red. We then guess right 80% of the time. Trying to match the frequency only gave the right answer 68% of the time.</p>
                <p class="calibre2">An <span>example of our tendency to see patterns that aren't there is when we use unreliable tests for evaluating people. A test is reliable if it gives about the same result when repeated assuming the test measures a characteristic that is stable over time. A test is valid if it accurately measures what it claims to measure. Take the Rorschach inkblot test as an example. One problem is that the test classifies a large percentage of normal individuals as psychologically disordered. Can we evaluate personality by studying how an individual perceives a series of inkblots? Interviewers can read into it whatever they wish to see. This test is still used today although research has shown that it allows for countless interpretations and has no predictive value.</span></p>

                <p class="calibre2">Our need for making sense makes us even believe in nonsense.</p>
                <p class="calibre2">In one experiment a social psychologist asked people standing in line to use a copying machine if she could go in front of them, <span>"Excuse me, I have 5 pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I have to make some copies?"Nearly </span>all agreed.</p>
                <p class="calibre2">When people ask us for a favor we are more likely to comply if they give us a reason - even if we don't understand the reason or it is wrong. Often it isn't the reason itself that is important, but the way the reason is phrased. Sometimes the word "because," without a sensible reason, is all that matters. We want explanations and the word "because" imply an explanation.</p>
                <p class="calibre2">Carl Braun, the creator of CF Braun Engineering Company, understood the importance of telling people "why." Charles Munger tells us the story:</p>
                <p class="calibre2">
                  <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
                </p>
                <p class="calibre2">His rule for all the Braun Company's communications was called the five W's - you had <span>to </span>tell <span>who </span>was going <span>to </span>do <span>what, where, when </span>and <span>why. </span>And if you wrote a letter or directive in the Braun Company telling somebody to do something, and you didn't tell him why, you could get fired. In fact, you would get fired if you did it twice.</p>
                <p class="calibre2">You might ask why that is so important? Well, again that's a rule of psychology. Just as you think better if you array knowledge on a bunch of models that are basically answers to the question, <span>why, why, why, </span>if you always tell people why, they'll understand it better, they'll consider it more important, and they'll be more likely to comply. Even if they don't understand your reason, they'll be more likely to comply.</p>
                <p class="calibre2">So there's an iron rule that just as you want to start getting worldly wisdom by asking why, why, why in communicating with other people about everything, you want <span>to </span>include why, why, why.</p>

                <p class="calibre2">"How can I use what I don't understand?"</p>
                <p class="calibre2">Understanding reasons is an important factor in learning. To learn, remember, organize, and use ideas, we must understand the "why" and "how." There's no use memorizing what we don't understand. <span>If </span>we don't understand the meaning of an idea, we don't use it. What we don't use, we forget. We also need to be motivated to learn. And we can't be motivated if we don't understand why we need to learn something. We need to see its practical use.</p>
                <p class="calibre2">Understanding is about the ability of seeing patterns - how ideas and things relate and hang together. Knowledge that can be used in a variety of situations.</p>
                <p class="calibre2">Our brains favor the concrete and practical over the abstract and theoretical. We are especially good at remembering images and spatial information. We therefore learn better if the use of ideas and patterns are illustrated through pictures and simple, clear and vivid real-life stories. Stories on what works and what doesn't work increase our ability to retain what we've learned.</p>
                <p class="calibre2">Aristotle said: "For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them." This means we need to practice what we have learnt in various situations.</p>
                <p class="calibre2">We also need an organizing framework in order to better retrieve and use knowledge. Charles Munger adds: "You can't really know anything if you just remember isolated facts and try and bang 'em back. <span>If </span>the facts don't hang together on a latticework of theory, you don't have them in a usable form."</p>

            <p class="calibre2">We start assuming that the product is good for us and look for evidence that confirms it. We believe people when they give us reasons. We believe that people are telling us the truth, even when they are not.</p>
            <p class="calibre2">We are not natural skeptics. We find it easy to believe, but difficult to doubt. Doubting is active and takes effort. Bertrand Russell said: "Believing seems the most mental thing we do." Why? Because we have to believe in order to understand.</p>
            <p class="calibre2">Studies show that in order to understand some information we must first accept it as true. The 17th Century philosopher Benedictus de Spinoza argued that understanding and believing are simply two different words for the same mental process. We first believe all information we understand and only afterwards and with effort do we evaluate, and if necessary, un-believe it. Studies show that Spinoza was right. We automatically and effortlessly believe what we see and hear and only afterwards (sometimes) with effort do we doubt and ask questions. Psychology Professor Daniel Gilbert says in his study <span>How Mentals Systems Believe: </span>"Having comprehended and accepted an idea, Spinoza considered persons entirely free either to <span>unaccept </span>or to <span>certify </span>it."</p>
            <p class="calibre2">Studies also show that the more distracted or pressured we are (and therefore prevented from thinking things through), the more likely we believe in something we normally would find dubious. Whether we think things through or not depends on our motivation and ability.</p>
            <p class="calibre2">Believing something that is false may sometimes come with a benefit. For example, studies show that if students are told they are above average on a subject, they will do better.</p>

            <p class="calibre2">How successful are people at deceiving us?</p>
            <p class="calibre2">Can we catch a liar? We don't seem to be good at telling a truth from a lie. Studies show that people - even professionals - are slightly better than chance at distinguishing truths from lies. We seem to be better at judging when people are telling the truth than when they are telling a lie. Michel de Montaigne said: <span>"If </span>falsehood, like truth, had only one face, we would be in better shape. For we would take as certain the opposite of what the liar said. But the reverse of truth has a hundred thousand shapes and a limitless field."</p>

                <p class="calibre2">Our memory is selective. We remember certain things and distort or forget others. Every time we recall an event, we reconstruct our memories. We only remember fragments of our real past experiences. Fragments influenced by what we have learned, our experiences, beliefs, mood, expectations, stress, and biases. Certain experiences create strong feelings and are therefore more memorable than others. Dramatic or fearful experiences or events stick in our memories. Emotional events are better remembered than unemotional ones. That is why we learn better if information is tied to a vivid story. Learning is also tied to mood.</p>
                <p class="calibre2">We learn better in a positive mood. That is why teaching should be performed in a way that creates powerful positive emotions among students.</p>
                <p class="calibre2">Psychology Professor Daniel Schacter, proposes in <span>The Seven Sins of Memory</span></p>
                <p class="calibre2">that our memory's malfunctions can be divided into seven "sins."</p>
                <p class="calibre2">(1) <span>Our memory weakens and we lose memory over time. (2) We are preoccupied with distracting issues and don't focus attention on what we need to remember. (3) We search for information that we may be desperately trying to retrieve - something we know that we know - but are blocked. (4) We assign memory to the wrong source. (5) Memories are implanted as a result of leading questions, comments, or suggestions when we try to call up a past experience. (6) Our present knowledge influences how we remember our pasts. We often edit or entirely rewrite our previous experiences. (7) We recall disturbing events that we would prefer to eliminate from our minds altogether: remembering what we cannot forget, even though we wish that we could.</span></p>
                <p class="calibre2">Individuals remember the same things differently. We remember events that never happened or assign what happened to the wrong place, time or person. Studies show that memories of emotional experiences are often different from what actually happened. We misinterpret what we saw. That is why there are variations in eyewitness accounts. Many cases show that eyewitness identification evidence has been a significant cause of wrongful convictions. Especially the accuracy of eyewitness identification of strangers.</p>

                <p class="calibre2">Australian psychologist Donald Thomson appeared on a live TV debate about the unreliability of eyewitness testimony. He was later picked up by the police, placed in a lineup, and identified by a victim as the man who had raped her. But Thomson has an airtight alibi. The rape had occurred while he was on <span>TY. </span><span>It </span>later turned out that the rapist had attacked the woman as she was watching the very show on which Thomson had appeared.</p>
                <p class="calibre2">Studies show that we remember a face but wrongly remember the time and place we saw it. Leading and suggestive questions can cause misidentification, and influence by information obtained after the event. Studies show that it is easy get a witness to believe they saw something when they didn't. Merely let some time pass between their observation and the questioning. Then give them false or emotional information about the event. Psychology Professor Elisabeth Loftus' work has shown that people can be led to remember rather familiar and common experiences, even when they had not happened. For example, her studies show that people can believe that a childhood experience had happened when it never happened.</p>
                <p class="calibre2">Studies show that jurors believe witnesses even when they are later shown to have made an incorrect identification. Eyewitnesses can be highly inaccurate but appear confident. The more confident people are when they appear as witnesses, the more believable the jurors will find them. The more detailed their memory of a situation is, the more the jurors trust them. Testimonial evidence is vivid and therefore more believable.</p>

                <p class="calibre2">Childhood memories are unreliable and influenced by fantasies and suggestions. Experiments have shown how normal children behave in response to suggestions. Implanted false stories can have a huge impact. Children can actually believe an event that never happened or produce false narratives for the event. Over time, their stories may become elaborate and filled with vivid details, making them more believable.</p>

                <p class="calibre2">When John asked why the company continued making acquisitions when so many of them turned sour, the CEO replied: "All my colleagues do deals like this. Plus how can I keep my job and all my perks <span>if </span>I don't keep busy?"</p>
                <p class="calibre2">Blaise Pascal said: "Man finds nothing so intolerable as to <span>be </span>in a state of complete rest, without passions, without occupation, without diversion, without effort." We sometimes act because we can't sit still. We feel bored, impatient, threatened or pressured or we simply desire excitement and stimulation. We act without a sensible reason. It seems easier to explain doing something than actively doing nothing.</p>
                <p class="calibre2">Warren Buffett tells why CEOs like acquisitions:</p>
                <p class="calibre2">
                  <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
                </p>
                <p class="calibre2">The sad fact is that most major acquisitions display an egregious imbalance: They are a bonanza for the shareholders of the acquiree; they increase the income and status of the acquirer's management; and they are a honey pot for the investment bankers and other professionals on both sides... often the CEO asks a strategic planning staff, consultants or investment bankers whether an acquisition or two might make sense. That's like asking your interior decorator whether you need a $50,000 rug.</p>
                <p class="calibre2">The acquisition problem is often compounded by a biological bias: Many CEO's attain their positions in part because they possess an abundance of animal spirits and ego. <span>If </span>an executive is heavily endowed with these qualities - which, it should be acknowledged, sometimes have their advantages - they won't disappear when he reaches the top. When such a CEO is encouraged by his advisors to make deals, he responds much as would a teenage boy who is encouraged by his father to have a normal sex life. It's not a push he needs.</p>

              <p class="calibre2">Francis Bacon said: "The guilt of Senses is of two sorts, either it destitutes us, or else deceives us." Emotions come before reason. Often when we make a decision our feelings take over. We hear bad news first. Under the influence of intense emotions we sometimes make hasty judgments and choices we would normally never do. For example, we buy things we can't afford, we have unprotected sex, we overeat, and use drugs. Studies also show that when we are in a state of more rational calm, we underestimate how we will feel and act when we experience intense emotions.</p>

              <p class="calibre2">One study tried to find out how disgust and sadness influenced economic decisions. All participants in the study watched a movie immediately before conducting financial transactions. Some watched a sad movie. Others a disgusting movie and a third group an emotionally neutral movie. Participants insisted that their feelings didn't affect what they were willing <span>to </span>pay for something or what price they were willing <span>to </span>accept. The study showed otherwise. Disgust reduced their selling and buying prices. Sadness cut their selling prices but raised their buying prices.</p>
              <p class="calibre2">We saw under loss aversion and deprival that we put a higher value on things we already own than on the same things if we don't own them. Sadness reverses this effect, making us willing <span>to </span>accept less money to sell something that we would pay for the same thing.</p>
              <p class="calibre2">This means, that when we feel sad, which often reflects helplessness and loss, we may want <span>to </span>change our circumstances so we feel better. This may cause us to overpay for something or buy things we don't need. That is why Mary went on a shopping spree. She needed some retail therapy. When we feel disgust we may be reluctant to buy anything new unless we find it is a real bargain. When we feel sadness or disgust we may want <span>to </span>get rid of things we have and sell them for less than what they are worth.</p>

              <p class="calibre2">We expect that if good or bad things happen to us in the future, they will make us feel better or worse much longer and more intensively than they actually turn out to be. So John's new car will probably be less exciting than John expects. Neither will it excite John as long as he expected. Why? Because we tend to adapt to most good and bad things and circumstances and make them ordinary (adaptation is not inevitable - individual differences and conditions matter and some major life events produce long lasting or enduring changes in life satisfaction). Our feelings are also influenced by so many other things and people than the specific future event itself. Furthermore, the comparisons we make when we think about our future feelings are often not the comparisons we make when we experience the event.</p>
              <p class="calibre2">What about if we instead use our past good experiences to decide what we want? Can we trust our memories to guide us? Memories can be deceptive. We also underestimate how our tastes and preferences will change. The Roman poet Titus Lucretius Cams said: "As long as we do not have it, the object of our desire seems greater than anything else; as soon as we enjoy it, we long for something different with an equal craving."</p>
              <p class="calibre2">What could we do instead? When we make big decisions, we could compare our expected feelings with those of people who have similar experiences today. In that sense, we are not as unique as we think we are.</p>

              <p class="calibre2">Too much information, lack of predictability or control, too many choices, lack of sleep, social isolation, job status, crisis, catastrophes, fear, etc. cause stress. The less control we perceive we have over our lives, the easier we fall victim to stress. The more stress we experience, the more we tend to make decisions that are short term.</p>
              <p class="calibre2">Everything our brain interprets as a threat influences our biology. Our ancestors didn't suffer less stress than we did. But their stress was different. They met dangers that demanded fast physical reactions. Our stress is more social and psychological in nature.</p>

              <p class="calibre2">Stress affects concentration and memory. Long-term stress exposure upsets the brain's chemical balance. Stress may cause high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, back and stomach problems, headache, and depression. Studies show that when we feel stress the concentration of cortisol rises in the bloodstream. One effect of cortisol is <span>to </span>suppress the workings of our immune system. This makes us more vulnerable <span>to </span>diseases. Stress also counteracts the production of insulin (the hormone that processes blood sugar), causing the process of repair to slow down. Studies show that emotional stress creates longer recovery times in our bodies and may be more harmful to our health than non-emotional stress events like physical exercise.</p>

For example, he could make a dog react aggressively to a caretaker with whom the dog was once very loyal. The same can happen to people. All people have a certain level of tolerance to stress. Once it is passed, people begin <span>to </span>break down and what they earlier believed and liked are easily changed.

              <p class="calibre2">The more we believe we are in control, the less vulnerable we are to the negative effects of stress. Studies show that people who perceive themselves to be in control over a stressful situation experience less stress on their hearts and circulatory system.</p>
              <p class="calibre2">The status of our job matters. The Whitehall II study involving 17,000 civil servants showed that people with low perceived control over the work environment or people low in the organizational structure have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Our cortisol levels rise in response to the degree other people order us about. <span>As </span>we climb the social hierarchy health status improves. In Genome, science writer Dr. Matt Ridley comments on the Whitehall study: "Somebody in a low-grade job, such as a janitor, was nearly four times as likely to have a heart attack as a permanent secretary at the top of the heap."</p>
              <p class="calibre2">In another study researchers tried to find out the differences between business executives who became sick from exposure to high stress and those who didn't. They found that executives who stayed healthy had a sense of commitment to work and families, felt in control, and had a positive attitude toward challenges. They saw challenges as part oflife and an opportunity for growth rather than as a threat.</p>

              <p class="calibre2">The banker told me that other people I admire would jump at the opportunity. I made a commitment to the financiers and told TransCorp's CEO about the deal. I committed myself publicly and felt a need to follow-through. I concentrated my search on evidence that confirmed the greatness of the deal. I denied reality and thought nothing bad could happen. I didn't say what I thought for fear of social disapproval. The CEO of the company I wanted to acquire continuously gave me good reasons to pursue the deal. The more effort I put into the deal, the more I felt I had to do it. I finally signed the papers. When reality kicked in and the deal turned sour, I was in deep trouble. And so was TransCorp."</p>

              <p class="calibre2">Apart from incentive-caused bias, liking and social approval, what are some other tendencies chat operate here? Authority - the CEO is the authority figure who directors tend to trust and obey. He may also make it difficult for those who question him. Social proof - the CEO is doing dumb things but no one else is objecting so all directors collectively stay quiet - silence equals consent; illusions of the group as invulnerable and group pressure (loyalty) may also contribute. Reciprocation - unwelcoming information is withheld since the CEO is raising the directors fees, giving them perks, caking them on trips or letting chem use the corporate jet. Association and Persian Messenger Syndrome - a single director doesn't want to be the carrier of bad news. Self-serving tendencies and optimism</p>

                  <p class="calibre2">No error in thinking about social facts is more serious than the failure to see their place and function.</p>

                  <p class="calibre2">Our behavior is influenced by social situational factors, conditions and circumstances, the structure or description of a problem or choice, and our desires, mood and expectations.</p>
                  <p class="calibre2">We tend to overestimate personal characteristics and motives when we explain the behavior of others. We underestimate situational factors like social pressure, roles or things over which there are no control. An example is, blaming an individual rather than a poorly designed system for failure. Chance also matters. Maybe we sometimes give too much blame to people who had bad luck, and too much credit to those who were simply lucky.</p>
                  <p class="calibre2">We expect people to be consistent in their behavior. But we behave differently in different situations. For example, we behave differently at home, in school, at work, and among friends; when alone and when in a group; when seen and when anonymous.</p>

                  <p class="calibre2">Extreme circumstance and conditions can cause people to do things they would never do under normal circumstances. Put good people in a bad situation and their normal behavior changes. The Zimbardo prison experiment at Stanford studied the roles people play in prison situations. Students were randomly assigned to the roles of prisoners and guards for a two-week period. Tests showed that all students were normal people and physically and mentally healthy. A simulated prison environment was created to mimic real-life prison conditions, where they lived for several days. Students playing guards behaved aggressively and students playing prisoners behaved helplessly. Guards rapidly began to treat the prisoners as if they were non-humans. The prisoners began acting depressed and showed extreme stress. The more the prisoners acted like non-humans, the more the guards mistreated them. The experiment ended after six days.</p>
                  <p class="calibre2">In a statement prepared for the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary, the originator of the experiment, Philip Zimbardo, said: "We were horrified because we saw some boys treat other boys as if they were despicable animals, taking pleasure in cruelty, while other boys became servile, dehumanized robots who thought only of escape, of their own individual survival, and of their mounting hatred of the guards."</p>
                  <p class="calibre2">Often when we are in a role, we tend to act as others expect. Zimbardo said: "Even when they thought they didn't have to meet anyone's expectations, the role of prison guard determined their actions."</p>
                  <p class="calibre2">An American Indian proverb says: "Don't judge a man until you've walked two moons in his moccasins." How would we behave if we were anonymous, part of a group, tired and exhausted, and others had been labeled as enemies, evil or worthless?</p>

                  <p class="calibre2">The less knowledgeable we are about an issue, the more influenced we are by how it is framed.</p>
                  <p class="calibre2">The answers we get depend on the questions we ask. The British philosopher</p>
                  <p class="calibre2">Herbert Spencer said: "How often misused words generate misleading thoughts." Consider how a statement, problem, consequence, or question is presented. How is it worded? What is its context? Are we considering certain features and ignoring others? Emotional, selective and appealing frames influence us.</p>
                  <p class="calibre2">How a choice is presented influences our preferences. For example, we prefer a product that is presented as "95% fat free" rather than "5% fat". We respond differently depending on whether something is presented in terms of gains or in terms oflosses. A surgical procedure that has a 40% chance of success seems more appealing than one that has a 60% chance of failure.</p>
                  <p class="calibre2">Frequencies appeal <span>to </span>our emotions. What is the chance that a mental patient commits an act of violence within 6 months after discharge? Studies show that experienced psychologists and psychiatrists judge the patient as more dangerous when the risk of violence were presented as relative frequencies (e.g., 20 criminals out of 100 similar to the patient are estimated to be violent to others...) than when the risk was presented as a probability (e.g., it is estimated that similar patients has a 20% chance of being violent to others ...). One study showed that a disease that kills 1,286 of 10,000 people (12.86%) was rated as riskier than one that kills 24.14 of 100 people (24.14%).</p>
                  <p class="calibre2">We are influenced by the order, first or last, in which a presentation happens. The key variable is the amount of time that separates the presentations, the time when we have to make a judgment, and which presentation is the most easily remembered.</p>
                  <p class="calibre2">Assume that two presidential candidates are speaking on an issue, one directly after the other. <span>If </span>some time passes before we have to make a judgment, we are likely to be more influenced by the first presentation. Assume now that some time passes between the first and last presentations, but we have <span>to </span>make a judgment immediately after the last presentation. Then we are more likely <span>to </span>be influenced by the last presentation.</p>

                  <p class="calibre2">In one experiment psychologists found that people who lost a $10 theater ticket on the way to the theatre were reluctant to buy a second ticket. Those who instead lost a $10 bill on the way to buy a $10 theatre ticket saw the loss of the money and the purchase of the ticket as unrelated, so they would buy the ticket. But, in both cases, the loss was the same.</p>
                  <p class="calibre2">We should view our assets in terms of their entirety. A dollar is a dollar independent of where it comes from. What counts is what we put in or take out of our pocket.</p>

Our behavior can be influenced by the expectations of others- teachers, coaches, bosses, etc. For example, to please the observer, a research subject may read in a desired result. A patient may wish to respond to a treatment in what they see as the correct way. We live up to what is expected of us.</p>

Yes, it produces a change in Mary's expectations of that individual and a change in her behavior. Mary will expect friendliness or hostility and behave according to her expectations. The person may react to Mary in a  way that confirms her expectations. We treat people like we expect them to be. If we expect people to be bad, we treat them in a certain way, which may cause them to behave badly.</p>

The environment? Assumptions? Importance? Cost of being wrong? Often there exists more than one right answer. The context of the task matters. In a more realistic, concrete, and social context, many tasks are often solved correctly.</p>

Part of what you must learn is how to handle mistakes and new facts that change the odds. Life, in part, is like a poker game, wherein you have to learn to quit sometimes when holding a much-loved hand.</p>

                      <p class="calibre2">I've gotten so that I now use a kind of two-track analysis. First, what are the factors that really govern the <span>interests </span>involved, rationally considered? And second, what are the subconscious influences where the brain at a <span>subconscious </span>level is automatically doing these things - which by and large are useful, but which often misfunction. One approach is rationality -  the way you'd work out a bridge problem: by evaluating the real interests, the real probabilities and so forth. And the other is to evaluate the psychological factors that cause subconscious conclusions - many of which are wrong.</p>

                  <p class="calibre2">Don't our feelings, instincts or our intuition help us avoid misjudgments?</p>
                  <p class="calibre2">Natural selection equipped us with traits adapted for the environment in which humans spent most of their time. Feelings like love, compassion, anger, fear, jealousy, and embarrassment can be explained biologically. They exist for a reason</p>
                </li>
                <li class="calibre6">
                  <p class="calibre2">to help us survive and reproduce. Somerset Maugham said: "Love is only a dirty trick played on us to achieve a continuation of the species." Why does sex feel good? Because it makes us reproduce. <span>If </span>sex felt painful, we wouldn't be here today. Our emotions are also part of the human whole. Our "good" emotions wouldn't be good without our "bad" emotions.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="calibre2">Feelings and instincts helped our ancestors navigate in the world. The ancestral environment rewarded actions before thought, emotion before reason. Fast intuitions and quick reactions are vital responses for organisms. Spending time pondering may be dangerous.</p>
              <p class="calibre2">The problem is that feelings can be twisted. Intuition is inconsistent and feelings can sometimes get out of control. Especially when we feel uncertain, distracted or stressed.</p>
              <p class="calibre2">Remember Chinese philosopher Lao-Tsu (604-531 BC): "He who knows men is clever; He who knows himself has insight; He who conquers men has force; He who conquers himself is truly strong."</p>

These are partly rooted in our psychological make-up; our tendency <span>to </span>use crude rules of thumb, and make hasty judgments and other psychological tendencies discussed in Part Two. They also have their roots in a lack of considering some basic ideas from physics and mathematics.</p>

I think that even people who aren't [expecting to] go <span>near </span>physics and engineering [in their planned profession] learn a thinking system in physics that is not learned so well anywhere else. Physics was a total eye-opener.</p>
              <p class="calibre2">The tradition of always looking for the answer in the most fundamental way available</p>
              <p class="calibre2">- that is a great tradition and it saves a lot of time in this world.

          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">A poor widow living alone in the country kept a faithful hen. Each morning the hen laid a big, brown egg for the woman's breakfast. One day the widow thought to herself: "Now ifI were to double my hen's allowance of barley, she would lay me two eggs a day instead of one." So she started feeding her biddy a double measure of grain, and soon the hen began <span>to </span>grow fat and sleek and lazy. <span>It </span>wasn't long before she stopped laying altogether.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">
          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">Every action has consequences. Both intended and unintended. No matter how carefully we plan, we can't anticipate everything. Often we fail to consider what other events are likely <span>to </span>occur as a result of some action. Politics, medicine, welfare programs, technology, military actions and laws generate unintended consequences. Whatever we do (or don't do), there are multiple consequences. They might not be what we expect. <span>In </span>one study, traffic engineers found that adding new routes (like a more direct road) could make traffic go slower. During merging, cars drive closer to each other and therefore slow down. Furthermore, studies of car safety show that wearing seat belt makes drivers feel more secure, making them drive faster or more recklessly.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">By solving one problem, we generate another one and sometimes create an even worse one.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">There was a problem with mice on campus. The solution for exterminating the mice was to pay students <span>$1 </span>for every dead mouse they delivered. It worked! Until the students began breeding the mice in order to make more money.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Actions have consequences and consequences have further effects. Charles Munger gives an example regarding Medicare:</p>
        <p class="calibre2">
          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">They had all these actuarial studies that showed the cost would be X.

          <a id="calibre_link-177">created a system wherein they were reimbursing both doctors and hospitals, in effect, on a cost plus percentage of cost basis.

        <p class="calibre2">Should good intentions eliminate bad consequences? No. Outcomes don't follow from intentions and intentions by definition apply only <span>to </span>intended consequences. But as Samuel Johnson said, "The road to hell is paved with good intentions." Isn't it more important to find out if the consequences are good rather than if the reasons are good? Ask: What are we trying to improve? What can reasonably be expected to happen? Are the net effects positive or negative?</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Good thinking is better than good intentions. In the 18th Century, Pierre S. du Pont, a deputy to the French National Assembly said: "Bad logicians have committed more involuntary crimes than bad men have done intentionally."</p>
        <p class="calibre2">But even good thinking can have undesired consequences. Charles Munger gives an example:</p>

They didn't consider other factors and conditions that influenced the value of the business. Some were changed as a consequence of TransCorp's decision to reduce prices in anticipation of higher volumes. Volume increases affect costs and behavior and need for investments in operating assets. There may also have been production problems due to technical constraints or the price decrease wasn't enough to make customers switch from the competition.</p>

But there was less silver in the mine than their expert guessed and less value than what MineCorp paid for the rights. This means that the winning bidder was cursed since the bid was higher than the value. Later it was shown that MineCorp also underestimated its costs of production.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">Research shows that the more bidders there are competing for a limited object, each having the same information, and the more uncertain its value is, the more likely we are to overpay. Instead, if our objective is <span>to </span>create value, the more bidders there are, the more conservative our bidding should be. This also implies that the less information we have compared to other bidders  or the more uncertain we are about the underlying value, the lower we should bid. <span>If </span>we participate in auctions, we must ascertain the true value of what's being sold or its value <span>to </span>us.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">Greek philosopher Heraclitus wrote: "Nothing endures but change." The world is too complicated to predict all the effects of some action. Maybe a business can predict scenarios like reduction in demand and intensified competition, but some events, their timing, magnitude or consequence, are impossible to anticipate.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Mark Twain said: "The art of prophecy is very difficult, especially with respect to the future." It is hard to predict something when we don't (or can't) foresee or understand how an entire system works, what key variables are involved, their attributes, how they influence one another and their impact. Even if we know the key variables, their values may be impossible to estimate. They may also change over time and be dependent on context. <span>It </span>may also be impossible to estimate how they will interact as a whole.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">The more parts involved and the more they interact, the more can happen, and the harder it is to determine consequences of individual actions.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">According to Dr. Gerald Edelman, the brain is an example of a complex system:</p>
        <p class="calibre2">
          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">A complex system is one in which smaller parts form a heterogeneous set of components which are more or less independent. But as these parts connect with each other in larger and larger aggregates, their functions tend to become integrated, yielding new functions that depend on such high order integration. This is, in fact, just what happens in the brain.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">
          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">As the number of variables grows, the number of possible interactions grows even faster. Assume that two subsystems, A and <span>B, </span>cause the behavior of a system.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">125</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Each subsystem consists of 5 parts. If we only consider two-way interactions among parts, there are 10 interactions between A-parts, 10 between B-parts, and 25 interactions between A and B parts. This means that the behavior of the system is composed of 55 determinants (SA-parts + 5B-parts + 10 interactions between A parts + 10 interactions between B-parts + 25 interactions between A and B parts). 18% (10 of 55) of all determinants derive from individual effects of parts in A and B while about 82% (45 of 55) derive from interactions. Now imagine a system where A and B each consists of 100 parts. There are now 20,100 determinants (100+100+4,950+4,950+10,000) and 19,900 interactions meaning that 99% (19,900 of20,100) of system determinants derive from interactions.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">We often take too little notice of how variables interact. Take the economy as an example. There are many factors to consider. They include interest rates, currency exchange rates, balance of trade figures, unemployment rates, consumer confidence, political factors, the stock market, business cycles, biases, etc. These factors are interconnected, and it is hard to tell which is most important. Add to this that people's behavior isn't fixed. We are emotional creatures, our preferences change, and we react to each other's actual or expected decisions. A prediction may also make us change our expectations and behavior, making the prediction more or less likely to come true.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Charles Munger says: "We try and predict what individual investments will swim well in relation to the tide. And then we tend to accept the effects of the tide as those effects fall."</p>

As far as I know, most of them are still gainfully employed, which ought to tell us something."</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Predictions about the future are often just projections of past curves and present trends. This is natural since our predictions about the future are made in the present. We therefore assume the future will be much like the present. But the future can't be known until it arrives. It is contingent on events we can't see. For example, who in the year 1900, could foresee events like World War I and II, the 1929 stock market crash, Chernobyl or technologies like the television, laser, computer, internet or the DVD? Many key inventions happened by accident and sagacity. For example, in 1867 Alfred Nobel accidentally discovered that when</p>

Nobody can forecast interest or currency rates, the GDP, turning points in the economy, the stock market, etc. Massive amounts of information, advanced computers or fancy mathematical formulas don't help. Warren Buffett says that we tend to put too much comfort in computer models and the precision they project: "We believe the precision they project is a chimera. In fact, such models can lull decision-makers into a false sense of security and thereby increase their chances of making a really huge mistake."</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Economics isn't like physics. There are no reliable or precise formulas where we easily can fill in the values of various economic factors, and then have the work done. Charles Munger says: "Economics involves too complex a system... economics should emulate physics' basic ethos, but its search for precision in physics-like formulas is almost always wrong in economics." J.M. Keynes adds: "To convert a model into a quantitative formula is to destroy its usefulness as an instrument of thought."</p>

        <p class="calibre2">That an event has happened many times before, doesn't mean that it will continue to happen. And just because an event has never happened before, doesn't mean it can't happen in the future. Take catastrophic events as an example.

Factors that can't be reliably measured ahead of time. Small changes in the temperature and pressure over the ocean can lead to large variations in the future development of storm systems. Weather predictions become more inexact the further out they are.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">The difficulty lies in initial condition uncertainties and model error. For example, small errors in the initial values ofvariables can grow and produce errors in the forecast. There may also be gaps in the initial data. But even if we know the initial conditions perfectly, the models are not perfect. Small model errors either in physics or numerics can also grow and produce different states. For example, not all atmospheric processes are understood. Furthermore, all weather models operate on a finite grid or limited area, typically in the order of 10 to 100 kilometers, depending on the study area. This means that the numerical resolution and representation is finite. But many physical processes and features that influence the weather occur on smaller scales than those resolved by the grid. For example, energy transfers at the surface, small atmospheric processes (such as isolated thunderstorms), topography, lakes, and vegetation. The model must treat or "parameterize" the effects of these "sub-grid" features' effects on the resolved scale. These parameterizations are simplifications and approximations and may also account for many of the model errors. So even if we know all the principles behind the weather and what governs the atmosphere, fundamental limitations make it hard to make accurate predictions.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Many meteorologists know they can't make a perfect forecast and have</p>
        <p class="calibre2">therefore given up on predicting whether it will or will not rain beyond a few days into the future. Instead, they have altered their approach and try to quantify the uncertainty in the prediction  ("The probability of precipitation is 20% this Saturday''). This uncertainty is small at short lead times and greater at longer lead times. <span>It </span>also varies with the weather situation, the location and the size of the area the prediction covers. When meteorologists make forecasts two weeks out, they look at the climatological frequency of precipitation, determined from a history of what has happened in the past.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">All prediction is inherently uncertain, and we have a duty to tell people about the uncertainties of our predictions and our past error rates. Albert Einstein wrote in a March 14, 1954, letter: "The right to search for truth... implies also a duty; one must not conceal any part of what one has recognized to be true."</p>

        <p class="calibre2">Living things are shaped and constrained by basic mathematical principles. Weight depends on volume and strength or load-bearing ability on area. The strength of a muscle or a bone is a function of cross-section area. Strength does not increase at the same rate as weight and volume. When we increase size, weight increases faster than strength. Scale up an organism and sooner or later it will be too weak <span>to </span>support its own weight. Double the size of a small dinosaur - twice as long, wide and high - and it weighs 8 times as much as before. We now need a neck that is 8 times stronger than before since it must hold 8 times the weight. But since the strength of the neck is proportional <span>to </span>its cross-section area, the neck is only 4 times stronger. There comes a point where the neck breaks.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">Assume we make a human 10 times larger than normal. This means he is now 10 times longer, 10 times wider, and 10 times higher. He now weighs 1,000 times more but he is only 100 times stronger (as muscular strength is proportional to the cross section area of a muscle). Since the load-bearing capacity of bones scales in the same manner his bones would be subject <span>to </span>ten times more stress than normal. He needs thicker bones to support more weight. Otherwise his legs will crush. This is why elephants have such thick stumpy legs <span>to </span>support their weight. The giant has 1,000 times more meat on the body but only 100 times the skin <span>to </span>hold it together meaning ten times the pressure on its skin (since pressure is proportional to area). This also means that his skin surface area is too small to remove the heat emitted from his huge body. He would suffer from overheating since the amount of heat his body produces is proportional to the cube of his length (1,000), while the amount of heat he dissipates through the skin is proportional <span>to </span>the square of his length (100).</p>

        <p class="calibre2">Another example is from chemistry. When a system of chemicals reaches a certain level of interaction, the system undergoes a dramatic change.

        <p class="calibre2">Both we and our customers derive significant operational benefits from our being the runaway leader in the fractional ownership business. We have more than 300 planes constantly on the go in the U.S. and can therefore be wherever a customer needs us on very short notice. The ubiquity of our fleet also reduces our "positioning" costs below those incurred by operators with smaller fleets. These advantages of scale, and others we have, give NetJets a significant economic edge over competition.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">In some businesses, the very nature of things is to sort of cascade toward the overwhelming dominance of one firm. The most obvious one is daily newspapers. There's practically no city lefr in the U.S., aside from a few very big ones, where there's more than one daily newspaper ... Once I get most of the circulation, I get most of the advertising. And once I get most of the advertising and circulation, why would anyone want the thinner paper with less information in it? So it tends to cascade to a winner-take-all situation.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">At some point the disadvantages of business size may eat into the advantages. For example, increased costs and investments, per-unit cost increases, systems become too complicated, bureaucratic and inefficient, etc.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">People's behavior may change when we change the scale of a group. What works well in a group of one size may not work at all in a group of another size. Garrett Hardin illustrates this as he examines the religious Hutterite communities in the northwestern U.S.:</p>
        <p class="calibre2">
          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">As <span>a colony grows in size, the propensity of the individual to claim a share of production "according to his needs" increases, while his eagerness to work "according to his ability" diminishes. The effectiveness of the overseers (preachers or bosses) also diminishes. Then, as shrinking increases, those less inclined to "goof off" begin to envy the brotherhood of drones, whom they presently join.</span></p>

          <a id="calibre_link-186">The Hutterites learned that scale or the number of people in each decision unit is important. Up to 150 people per colony, the system can be managed by the force of shame. Above this size an appeal to conscience loses its effectiveness and individuals begin to need more than they contribute. Studies show that groups of about 150 individuals are common in clans of hunter-gatherers, and military units. The spread of behavior and ideas depends on scale. A certain proportion or minimum number of people (a threshold) must make a choice before we follow their lead. Some examples are whether to join a strike or riot, adopt an idea, buy a product or stock, speak out on an issue, or leave a boring party. A critical</a>

        <p class="calibre2">Consider technological, physical, human, biological and mathematical constraints and limits. We can't send signals faster than the speed of light. There are limits to how small or large something can be. Gordon Moore, one of the founders oflntel, predicted in 1965 that the number of transistors that could be economically produced and placed on a silicon chip would double every 18 months. In 1995 he updated his prediction to once every two years. Eventually though, physical, engineering or economic limits may stop this from happening.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">Size and frequency</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Small earthquakes are common while big ones are rare.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Statistics show that the frequency of some events and attributes are inversely proportional to their size. Big or small things can happen but the bigger or more extreme they get, the less frequent they are. For example, there are a few large earthquakes, fires, avalanches, or cities, but many small ones. There are a few billionaires but many millionaires.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">The size and frequency of these events and attributes has a statistical pattern - a scaling relationship that is about the same independent of size (we saw earlier that there is a scaling relationship between the length of the ice cube's sides and its volume). For example there is a scaling relationship between earthquake magnitude and frequency. Based on observations from 1990, U.S. Geological Survey estimates the average annually frequency of magnitude 8 and higher earthquakes to 1, magnitude 7-7.9 to 17, magnitude 6-6.9 to 134, and magnitude 5-5.9 to 1319 earthquakes. Still, the patterns are based on past statistics and estimates. They don't help us to precisely predict future events. For example, catastrophes occur randomly. We don't know when the next big one will occur.</p>

For example, a few defects produce most of the problem, or a few individuals cause most of the problems. A few criminals commit most of the crime. It is estimated that about 5% of movies earn about 80 to 90% of profits in the movie industry.

        <p class="calibre2">Optimization of one variable may cause the whole system to work less efficiently. Why? The performance of most systems is constrained by the performance of its weakest link. A variable that limits the system from achieving its goal or optimum performance.

Maybe the constraint is based on faulty assumptions that can be corrected. Then try to "strengthen" or change the weakest link. Watch out for other effects - wanted or unwanted - that pop up as a consequence. Always consider the effects on the whole system.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">We believe that cause resembles its effect - for example, that large or important effects must have large causes or that complicated outcomes have complicated underlying reasons. But the size of an effect may not be proportional to its cause. Small things may break a large system. In 1988, 35 people died and 113 were injured when a London-bound commuter train crashed into the back of a stationary train. The accident was caused by faulty wiring work. A mechanic worked more than 12 hours with only a 5-minute break and forgot to remove a small wire from an old switch when installing a new rail signaling system.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">What happened? The core cause was the failed conversion of English units (pounds) to metric units (newton). The manufacturer measured the force of small control thrusters in pounds but the space officials expected newtons. A misunderstanding that sent the spacecraft about 56 miles too close to Mars, making it disappear into the Martian atmosphere. A simple mistake caused the loss of a $125 million spacecraft.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">Dirty hands can cause major health problems. Among bacteria that reproduce by dividing themselves every half hour, a single one can generate about 17 million offspring within 12 hours. Records at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that every year close to 2 million people (out of 35 million admissions annually) in the U.S. pick up an infection in the hospital. Of those people, about 90,000 die as a result of their infection. And the major reason is bad hygiene like unsanitary conditions, germ-laden instruments and unwashed hands. CDC and the U.S. Department and Health and Human Services estimate that strict adherence to clean-hand policies alone could save the lives of 20,000 patients. That washing hands saved lives was discovered in 1847 by the Hungarian gynecologist Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis. When working at the Maternity Department of the Vienna Hospital, he observed that women delivered by medical students had high mortality rates while those delivered by midwife trainees had low rates of childbed fever. The difference? The medical students had made pathological dissections, or had come into contact with dead bodies before the examination of the women. Semmelweis introduced the practice of washing hands in a solution of chlorinated lime before every examination and mortality</p>

        <p class="calibre2">For example, behavior is determined by a multitude of psychological and non psychological factors, individual characteristics and the given situation. Sometimes these factors interact and reinforce each other. When explaining behavior, think in terms of multiple causes. For example, Charles Munger says on the Milgram experiment discussed in Part Two (where a group of research subjects delivered electric shocks simply because they were told to do so by an authoritative figure):</p>

Of course, that's mere first conclusion bias. That's not the complete and correct explanation. Authority is part of it. However, there was also quite a few other psychological principles [consistency, contrast, reason-respecting], all operating in the same direction, which achieved that lollapalooza effect precisely because they acted in combination toward the same end.</p>

            <p class="calibre2">cultures and visionary leaders. To understand what qualities cause success, we need to compare business successes with failures. We must include companies that started with the same quality but failed. The problem though, is that the data for failures often disappears. Furthermore, what works in one situation may fail in another.</p>
            <p class="calibre2">By interviewing survivors of fatal airline accidents, a 1986 <span>Discover </span>article presented some tips on how we could improve our chances of surviving plane crashes. But as noted by Psychology Professor Robyn Dawes, there was no evaluation of what percent of all passengers did what the survivors did. Maybe those who died also had done the same. Of course, we can't interview the passengers who didn't survive.</p>
            <p class="calibre2">Often the same attributes are used <span>to </span>explain both success and failure. For example, when a company is successful, the media say that it is because of its focus and great leadership. When performance goes down, they report that the company became less focused and its leadership deteriorated. While there may be evidence that the company is less focused or has worse leadership than before, it could just as well be that the competition has gotten better. Business performance is relative, not absolute. The performance of a business is always influenced by what its competitors do. Even if a company gets better in many areas, market share and profits may decline if the competition does things even better. And even if a company gets worse in many areas, market share and profits may increase if competition does things even worse.</p>

            <p class="calibre2">Always look at what numbers mean. For example, ask: Does the magnitude make sense? <span>In </span>relation to what? Also, think about what counts - not how it is counted. There was a sign hanging in the physicist Albert Einstein's office at Princeton that said: "Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts."</p>

            <p class="calibre2">The sequence of numbers 2, 4, 8, 16 grows exponentially. Day 2 his son would have 2 cents, day 3, 4 cents. After 27 days, he would have $1.3 million dollars. The individual growth is constant - 100% a day- but the sum gets higher faster and faster. This is the power of doubling.</p>
            <p class="calibre2">As we have seen there are limits to prolonged growth. Take bacteria as an example. Assume that a certain strain of bacteria divide in one minute. We put the bacteria in a bottle at 11 am and the bottle is full at noon. When was the bottle half <span>full? - </span>11 :59 am. Just one minute earlier.</p>
            <p class="calibre2">Even a small number of steady growth leads eventually to doubling and redoubling. For example, a country whose population grows by 2% a year, double in size in 35 years and redoubles in 70 years. A simple formula for doubling time is found by dividing 70 by the percent growth per year.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">How likely do we believe it is that some event will occur? Probabilities are like guesses. But as Richard Feynman said in his <span>Caltech Lectures on Physics: </span>"There are good guesses and there are bad guesses. The theory of probability is a system for making better guesses."</p>
        <p class="calibre2">We can either estimate the probability based on its relative frequency (proportion of times the event happened in similar situations in the past) or we can make an educated guess using past experiences or whatever important and relevant information and evidence that is available.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">We can also count possible outcomes. The only time we can calculate the exact probability of an event in advance (over a large number of trials) is in cases where we know all possible outcomes and where all outcomes are equally likely. This is applicable for games of chance such as tossing a coin or rolling a die. However we use the notion of probability, we need to follow its basic rules.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">How like/,y is it that a hurricane strikes Texas?</p>
        <p class="calibre2">According to the National Hurricane Center, there have been 36 hurricane strikes in Texas from 1900 to 1996. Based on past experience and barring no change in conditions, we can estimate that there is about a 37% (36/97) chance that a hurricane will strike Texas in any given year. This figure - 36/97 - is also called the base rate frequency of outcomes (hurricanes in Texas).</p>
        <p class="calibre2">We must make sure that the conditions that produced the relative frequency can be expected to be pretty much the same before we can use it as a guide for the future. We must also look at variations of outcome and severity (how much damage an event may cause). Take tornadoes as an example. According to the National Climatic Data Center, between 1950 to 1999 there has been an average of 810 tornadoes yearly in the U.S. But in 1950 there was 201 tornadoes (causing 70 deaths), in 1975, 919 (causing 60 deaths), and in 1999, 1,342 tornadoes (causing</p>
        <p class="calibre2">94 deaths).</p>

        <p class="calibre2">A doctor says, "This is the first time I've seen this disease. I estimate there is a 50-50 chance that the patient will survive. <span>"</span></p>
        <p class="calibre2">This statement has only two possible outcomes. Either the patient dies or not. Does it really make any sense to say "a 50-50 chance" if there are no past data or other evidence to base the probability on? Does it really tell us something? <span>If </span>there are no historical, comparable or representative data or other evidence <span>to </span>base an estimate on, the probability figure only measures the doctor's belief in the outcome of the event.</p>

          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">Another doctor says, "According to medical records of similar cases, under the same conditions, 50% of the patients survived five years or longer."</p>
        <p class="calibre2">The more representative background data or evidence we have the better our estimate of the probability.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">To narrow down the probability figure even more, we need a relevant comparison group, i.e., a group to which a frequency refers. <span>In </span>the hurricane example, we defined the probability for a specific comparison group, referring <span>to </span>the relative frequency with which hurricanes have occurred (37 times in Texas during the 97 years for which we have data).</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Events may happen with great frequency or rarely. Some events are not repeatable and some events have never happened before. For certain events, past experience may not be representative. Others are characterized by low past frequency and high severity. Unforeseen events occur where our actual exposure (measures vulnerability and potential cost or loss) is unknown. Sometimes people react <span>to </span>an event by avoiding or preventing it in the future causing a change of the events future probability. Other times one bad event may increase the chance of another. For example, an earthquake may cause landslides, floods, or power blackouts. The more uncertainty there is, the harder it is to find a meaningful probability number. Instead our estimate must be constrained <span>to </span>a range of possible outcomes and their probabilities.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Uncertainty increases the difficulty for insurers to appropriately pnce catastrophes, such as hurricanes or earthquakes. Warren Buffett says:</p>
        <p class="calibre2">
          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">Catastrophe insurers can't simply extrapolate past experience. <span>If </span>there is truly "global warming," for example, the odds would shift, since tiny changes in atmospheric conditions can produce momentous changes in weather patterns. Furthermore, in recent years there has been a mushrooming of population and insured values in U.S. coastal areas that are particularly vulnerable to hurricanes, the number one creator of super-cats. A hurricane that caused x dollars of damage 20 years ago could easily cost 1Ox now.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">Occasionally, also, the unthinkable happens. Who would have guessed for example, that a major earthquake could occur in Charleston, S.C.? (It struck in 1886, registered an estimated 6.6 on the Richter scale, and caused 60 deaths.)</p>
        <p class="calibre2">
          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">But it may still be possible to price sensibly. Warren Buffett says:</p>
        <p class="calibre2">
          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">Even if perfection in assessing risks is unattainable, insurers can underwrite sensibly. After all, you need not know a man's precise age to know that he is old enough to vote nor know his exact weight to recognize his need to diet.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">
          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">Warren Buffett also considers a worst case scenario:</p>
        <p class="calibre2">
          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">Given the risks we accept, Ajit [Ajit Jain; manager of Berkshire's reinsurance operations] and I constantly focus on our "worst case," knowing, of course, that it is difficult to judge what this is, since you could conceivably have a Long Island hurricane, a California earthquake, and Super Cat X all in the same year. Additionally, insurance losses could be accompanied by non-insurance troubles. For example, were we to have super-cat losses from a large Southern California earthquake, they might well be accompanied by a major drop in the value of our holdings in See's, Wells Fargo and Freddie Mac...</p>
        <p class="calibre2">We do, though, monitor our aggregate exposure in order to keep our "worst case" at a level that leaves us comfortable.</p>

          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">How reliable is past experience for predicting the future? In <span>Against the Gods, </span>Peter Bernstein refers to a 1703 letter written by German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz to the Swiss scientist and mathematician Jacob Bernoulli referring to mortality rates: "New illnesses flood the human race, so that no matter how many experiments you have done on corpses, you have not thereby imposed a limit on the nature of events so that in the future they could not vary." Even with the best empirical evidence, nobody knows precisely what will happen in the future.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">After the September 11, 2001, catastrophe, Warren Buffett wrote on the importance on focusing on actual exposure and how using past experience sometimes may be dangerous:</p>
        <p class="calibre2">
          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">In setting prices and also in evaluating aggregation risk, we had either overlooked or dismissed the possibility oflarge-scale terrorism losses... In pricing property coverages, for example, we had looked to the past and taken into account only costs we might expect to incur from windstorm, fire, explosion and earthquake. But what will be the largest insured</p>
        <p class="calibre2">
          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">146</p>
        <p class="calibre2">property loss in history (after adding related business interruption claims) originated from none of these forces. In short, all of us in the industry made a fundamental underwriting mistake by focusing on experience, rather than exposure, thereby assuming a huge terrorism risk for which we received no premium.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Experience, of course, is a highly useful starting point in underwriting most coverages. For example, it's important for insurers writing California earthquake policies to know how many quakes in the state during the past century have registered 6.0 or greater on the Richter scale. This information will not tell you the exact probability of a big quake next year, or where in the state it might happen. But the statistic has utility, particularly if you are writing a huge statewide policy...</p>
        <p class="calibre2">At certain times, however, using experience as a guide to pricing is not only useless, but actually dangerous. Late in a bull market, for example, large losses from directors and officers liability insurance ("D&amp;O") are likely <span>to </span>be relatively rare. When stocks are rising, there are a scarcity of targets <span>to </span>sue, and both questionable accounting and management chicanery often go undetected. At that juncture, experience on high-limit D&amp;O may look great.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">But that's just when <i class="calibre4">exposure </i>is likely to be exploding, by way of ridiculous public offerings, earnings manipulation, chain-letter-like stock promotions and a potpourri of other unsavory activities. When stocks fall, these sins surface, hammering investors with losses that can run into the hundreds of billions.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">Even if we for some events can't estimate their probability, there may be some evidence telling us if their probabilities are increasing or decreasing. Ask: Do I understand the forces that can cause the event? What are the key factors? Are there more opportunities for the event to happen?</p>

        <p class="calibre2">This is a simplified way of saying that the more possible outcomes an event has (in number or time), the less likely a specific outcome is (for example only one outcome satisfies the wanted event: "roll a die once and observe a six") and the more likely some outcome is (there are 6 possible outcomes <span>to </span>choose from). The more possible outcomes a specific event has, and the more they are unwanted, and the more independent events that are needed to achieve a scenario, the less likely it is that the wanted scenario happens.

        <p class="calibre2">may be less likely than others (for example, due to constraints or limits).</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Treat rolling a die 3 times as 3 separate events where each event is "observe a six".

        <p class="calibre2">We talk about what is likely <span>to </span>happen in the long run. We might be lucky and roll 3 sixes in a row. We must also consider the consequences of an unwanted outcome.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">What does this mean? <span>If </span>there are more ways of reaching a bad outcome than</p>
        <p class="calibre2">a good outcome, the probability of a bad outcome is higher. <span>It </span>is easier <span>to </span>destroy a system than to create one merely because there are more opportunities for destruction than creation.</p>

        <p class="calibre2"><span>Why do we lose money gambling? Why do we invest in exotic long shot ventures? </span>We often overestimate the chance of low probability but high-payoff bets.

What is Mary's chance of winning "Lotto <span>6/49" </span>if there are <span>14 </span>million outcomes? What must happen? She must pick 6 numbers out of <span>49 </span>and if they all match she wins. What can happen? How many numbers can she choose from? The possible number of ways she can choose <span>6 </span>numbers out of <span>49 </span>is <span>13,983,816. </span>The probability that someone chooses the winning combination is therefore one in about <span>14 </span>million.

        <p class="calibre2">Imagine the time it takes to put together <span>14 </span>million combinations. <span>If </span>we assume every combination on average takes 1 minute to put down on paper, and Mary pick numbers for <span>24 </span>hours a day, it will take her <span>27 </span>years to write them all down.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Even if Mary invests <span>$14 </span>million to buy <span>14 </span>million tickets in the hopes of winning a <span>$20 </span>million jackpot, she may have to share the jackpot with others that picked the winning number. <span>If </span>just one other person picked the winning combination, she would lose <span>$4 </span>million <span>(20/2- 14).</span></p>

          <a id="calibre_link-204">Why do people play a game when the likelihood of losing is so high? Even if we exclude the amusement factor and the reinforcement from an occasional pay off, it is understandable since they perceive the benefit of being right as huge and the cost of being wrong as low - merely the cost of the ticket or a dollar. Remember the advice of Benjamin Franklin: "He that waits upon fortune, is never sure of a dinner."</a>

        <p class="calibre2">Mathematical expectation</p>
        <p class="calibre2">A lottery has JOO tickets. Each ticket costs $10. The cash price is $500. Is it worthwhile for Mary to buy a lottery ticket?</p>
        <p class="calibre2">The expected value of this game is the probability of winning (1 in 100) multiplied with the price ($500) less the probability of losing (99 out of 100) multiplied with the cost of playing ($10). For each outcome we take the probability and multiply the consequence (a reward or a cost) and then add the figures. This means that Mary's expected value of buying a lottery ticket is a loss of about $5 (0.01 x $500 - 0.99 x $10).</p>
        <p class="calibre2">We need to separate between few games and many games. Since probability means the number of times an event is likely <span>to </span>happen during a large number of trials, the expected value is the amount Mary should expect to win or lose per game if she made the same bet many times. Expected value tells Mary that she on average should expect to lose $5 every time she plays if she plays the same lottery over and over. Not what she can expect from a single game. Mary has a 1</p>
        <p class="calibre2">% chance of winning the lottery and if she wins, her gain is $490. She has a 99</p>
        <p class="calibre2">% chance oflosing $10.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Most of our decisions in every-day life are one-time bets. Choices we face only once. Still, this is not the last decision we make. There are a large number of uncertain decisions we make over a lifetime. We make bets every day. So if we view life's decisions as a series of gambles, we should use expected value as a guide whenever appropriate. Over time, we will come out better.</p>

The casino has the advantage.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">There are 38 different numbers (including double zero) on the roulette wheel. When the croupier spins the wheel there is an equal chance of the ball landing in any one of the 38 slots. John puts $1 on a single number. <span>If </span>his number comes</p>

As a casino operator said: "What I love is the risk. Some nights we make money, and other nights we make more money."</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Even if we win in the short run, human nature turns us into losers. Nearly all of those who win big continue to play until they have lost their gains, and perhaps more. This is well illustrated by Henry Howard Harper in his book, <span>The Psychology of Speculation:</span></p>

        <p class="calibre2"><span>It </span>is said to be a proven fact that the chances are so much against the player, that a roulette wheel can be run at a profit, even if the percentage in favor of the house is entirely eliminated. This is due <span>to </span>the fact that the excitement of play causes a certain confusion of mind, and players are prone to do the wrong thing; for instance, double their bets when in an adverse run of luck and "pinch" them when luck is running favorably. Or, on the other hand, players who have pressed their advantage and doubled in a run of favorable luck will continue stubbornly <span>to </span>plunge long after their luck has changed. Precisely the same psychology applies to trading in stocks.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">We tend to believe that the probability of an independent event is lowered when it has happened recently or that the probability is increased when it hasn't happened recently. For example, after a run of bad outcomes in independent events that appear randomly, we sometimes believe a good outcome is due. But previous outcomes neither influence nor have any predictive value of future outcomes. There is neither memory nor a sense of justice.</p>

As the 19th Century French mathematician Joseph Bertrand said: "The coin has neither memory or consciousness." Mary committed the gambler's fallacy. This happens when we believe that when something has continued for a certain period of time, it goes back to its long-term average. This is the same as the roulette player when he bets on red merely because black has come up four times in a row. But black has the same chance as red to come up on the next spin. Each spin, each outcome is independent of the one before. Only in the long run will the ratio of red to black become equal.</a>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">Every single time Mary plays, the probability it lands on heads is 50% and lands on tails 50%. Even if we know that the probability is 50%, we can't predict if a given flip results in a head or tail. We may flip heads ten times in a row or none.

        <p class="calibre2">What is a" 100-year storm?" To predict storms we look at past statistics i.e., how often in the recorded past a storm of a certain magnitude has occurred. We also assume that the same magnitude of storm will occur with the same frequency in the future. A 100-year storm doesn't mean it happens only once every 100 years. It could happen any year. <span>If </span>we get a once in 100-year storm this year, another big one could happen next year. A 100-year event only means that there is a 1% chance that the event will happen in any given year. So even if large storms are rare, they occur at random. The same reasoning is true for floods, tsunamis, or airplane crashes. In all independent events that have random components in them, there is no memory of the past.</p>

They wanted four times as much money for selling the chosen ones compared to what they wanted for the randomly selected ticket. But in random drawings it doesn't make any difference if we choose a ticket or are assigned one. The probability of winning is the same. The lesson is, if you want <span>to </span>sell lottery tickets, let people choose their own numbers instead of randomly drawing them.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">"Pascal's Wager" is Blaise Pascal's argument for believing in God. Pascal reasoned as follows: <span>If </span>we believe in God, and God exists, we would gain in afterlife. <span>If </span>we don't believe in God, and God exists, we will lose in afterlife. Independent of the probabilities of a God, the consequences of not believing are so awful, we should hedge our bet and believe.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Pascal suggests that we are playing a game with 2 choices, believe and not believe, with the following consequences:</p>

        <p class="calibre2">If <span>God exists, and we believe God exists, we are saved. This is good. </span>If <span>we don't believe, and God is unforgiving, we are damned. </span>If <span>we believe but God doesn't exist, we miss out on some worldly pleasures. </span>If <span>God doesn't exist and we don't believe that God exists, we live a normal life.</span></p>
        <p class="calibre2">Expected value of believing= p (the value of being saved) <span>+ </span>(1-p)(the cost of inconvenience)</p>

        <p class="calibre2">Pascal said: <span>"If </span>I lost, I would have lost little. <span>If </span>I won I would have gained eternal life." Our choice depends on the probabilities, but Pascal assumed that the consequences of being damned is infinite, meaning the expected value of believing is least negative and therefore he reasoned that believing in God is best no matter how low we set the probability that God exists.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">If <span>John wins he gets $10 million. Should he play? There are 6 equally likely possible outcomes when he pulls the trigger - empty, empty, empty, empty, empty, bullet.

        <p class="calibre2">Should he play this game once? The probability is 83% that he gets $10 million. The probability is only 17% that he loses.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Let's look at the consequences: <span>If </span>John doesn't play and there was a bullet he is glad he didn't play. <span>If </span>he plays and there is a bullet, he dies. <span>If </span>he doesn't play and there was no bullet he loses the pleasure which the extra money could have bought him. <span>If </span>he plays and there is no bullet he gains $10 million which would buy him extra pleasure. To play is to risk death in exchange for extra pleasure. There is an 83% probability that John is right but the consequence of being wrong is fatal. Even if the probabilities favor him, the downside is unbearable. Why should John risk his life? The value of survival is infinite, so the strategy of not playing is best no matter what probability we assign for the existence of "no bullet" or what money is being offered. But there may be exceptions. Someone that is poor, in need of supporting a family who knows he will die of a lethal disease within 3 months might pull the trigger. He could lose 3 months of life,</p>

        <p class="calibre2">just as john started to renovate his house, TransCorp initiated a billion-dollar project. <span>Why do house construction projects, start-ups or product development ventures take more time, money and effort than we expect? For example, one study found that of 3,500 projects executed, the project budget was often exceeded by 40 - 200%. Studies by Planning Professor Bent Flyvbjerg found that about 9 out of 10 transportation infrastructure projects had cost overruns. His studies also found large deviations between forecast and actual traffic demand volumes. He gives us several examples: Boston's Central Artery Tunnel was 275% or $11 billion over budget in constant dollars. Costs for Denver's $5 billion International Airport were dose to 200% higher than estimated and passenger traffic in the opening year was half of that projected. Denmark's Great Belt underwater rail tunnel had cost over-runs by 110%. Other examples on projects with cost overruns and benefit shortfalls are Bangkok's Skytrain, Los Angeles' convention center, Quebec's Olympic stadium, the Eurofighter military jet, the Channel Tunnel, the Pentagon Spy Satellite Program, and Athens' 2004 Olympics.</span></p>
        <p class="calibre2">A project is composed of a series of steps where all must be achieved for success. Each individual step has some probability of failure. We often underestimate the large number of things that may happen in the future or all opportunities for failure that may cause a project to go wrong. Humans make mistakes, equipment fails, technologies don't work as planned, unrealistic expectations, biases including sunk cost-syndrome, inexperience, wrong incentives, contractor failure, untested technology, delays, wrong deliveries, changing requirements, random events, ignoring early warning signals are reasons for delays, cost overruns and mistakes. Often we focus too much on the specific project case and ignore what normally happens in similar situations (base rate frequency of outcomes-personal and others).

        <p class="calibre2">The more independent steps that are involved in achieving a scenario, the more opportunities for failure and the less likely it is that the scenario will happen. We often underestimate the number of steps, people and decisions involved.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Add to this that we often forget that the reliability of a system is a function of the whole system. The weakest link sets the upper limit for the whole chain.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">TransCorp wants to develop a new product.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">To predict the probability of developing the new product we need to know all the steps in the product development chain and the probability of each one. The project is composed of 6 steps and each step is independent of the others. Each step has an 80% probability of success. Based on similar development programs performed under the same conditions, TransCorp estimates that 8 out of 10 times each step is successful. In 2 times out of 10 something happens that prevents each step from succeeding. But since each step is independent, the probabilities must be multiplied together. The probability the company finally succeeds in developing the product is 26% - meaning that TransCorp should expect success one time out of four. So even if each step had an 80% probability of success, when combined, the probability of product success decreases to 26%.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Every time we add another step to some system, the probability that the system works is reduced.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">Professor and startup coach John Nesheim, who has been involved in some 300 plus startups, tells us in <span>High Tech Startup, </span>that only six out of one million high tech ideas turn into a public company. This base rate frequency tells us there is a low prior probability of turning into a public company.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Take a biotech venture as an example. Studies show that of every 10,000 to 30,000 drug candidate molecule entering discovery, only 250 make it to pre clinical evaluation; only 5 to 10 to clinical; and only one gets approved. There are so many things that must go right before it becomes a business that generates money. Factors like technological virtue, product safety, cost-effectiveness, manufacturing, patent issues, product stability, regulatory matters, market assessment, competitive position, financial need (and availability), etc. How can we put a probability number on all these factors? And even if we can, these factors must all work to achieve the desired scenario. Ask: What is the prior probability of success for this type of venture before I consider this specific case?</p>

          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">How many of these companies are making a couple of hundred million dollars a year? It just doesn't <span>happen. </span>It's not that <span>easy </span><span>to </span>make lots of money in a business in a capitalistic society. There are people that are looking at what you're doing every day and trying <span>to </span>figure out a way to do it better, underprice you, bring out a better product or whatever it may be.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">The compensation we need for taking a risk is really a function of the wanted outcome in relation <span>to </span>all possible outcomes. Take rolling a die as an example. How likely is it that we get a six four times in a row? <span>If </span>we have to invest $1 to play this game once, we need to get back $1,296 <span>to </span>go even. There are 1,296 outcomes and only one of them is favorable (6,6,6,6).</p>
        <p class="calibre2">The more negative things that can happen - or positive things that must happen - the better compensated we must be for taking on the risk. Ask: What can happen and what are the consequences? Anticipate unforeseen obstacles.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">If <span>you do venture investments, follow the advice of Warren Buffett:</span></p>
        <p class="calibre2">
          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">You may consciously purchase a risky investment - one that indeed has a significant possibility of causing loss or injury - if you believe that your gain, weighted for probabilities, considerably exceeds your loss, comparably weighted, and if you can commit <span>to </span>a number of similar, but unrelated opportunities. Most venture capitalists employ this strategy. Should you choose to pursue this course, you should adopt the outlook of the casino that owns a roulette wheel, which will want to see lots of action because it is favored by probabilities, but will refuse <span>to </span>accept a single, huge bet.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">
          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">We can demonstrate Buffett's advice mathematically. Suppose a start-up has a 40% probability of succeeding. The probability that 10 mutually independent start-ups (with the same probability of success) all succeed is 0.01% but the probability that at least one succeeds is 99.4%. Here we assumed that the fate of each venture is independent of the fate of the other. That one start-up fails make it no more likely that another start-up fails.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">Consider bias from incentives. To sell in a venture, expected returns are often overestimated. Warren Buffett says, "We expect all of our businesses to now and then have ups and downs. (Only in the sales presentations of investment banks do earnings move forever upward.)"</p>

        <p class="calibre2">A stray metal strip on the runway lost by another aircraft caused the event. As a result a tire burst. Its explosion sent pieces of rubber into the fuel tank, causing a fuel leak and fire.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">We underestimate how likely it is that an event happens when it may happen one way or another. Accidents happen if they have opportunities to happen.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Astronomy Professor Carl Sagan said in <span>Carl Sagan: a life in the cosmos: </span>"The Chernobyl and Challenger disasters remind us that highly visible technological systems in which enormous national prestige had been invested can nevertheless experience catastrophic failures."</p>
        <p class="calibre2">System safety doesn't reside in one component but in the interactions of all the components. <span>If </span>one key component fails, the system may fail. Assume a space shuttle is composed of 2,000 independent parts or smaller systems, each with a workingprobabilityof99.9%. All parts need to work for the shuttle to work. The probability that at least one of the parts doesn't work causing the shuttle to malfunction is 86% (many parts means many opportunities for failure).</p>

        <p class="calibre2">The blackout began at 10:30 p.m. in the Omaha area and the domino effect caused a cascade of electricity cuts throughout <span>U.S.</span></p>
        <p class="calibre2">Some systems are more prone to accidents than others because of the number of components, their connections and interactions. The more variables we add to a system, and the more they interact, the more complicated we make it and the more opportunity the system has to fail. Improving certain parts in highly interconnected systems may do little to eliminate future problems. There is always the possibility of multiple simultaneous failures and the more complicated the system, the harder it is <span>to </span>predict all possible failures. The exception to this is systems that serve as a substitute if the present system breaks down. We must ensure that backup systems don't cause unwanted effects or that some parts share the same defects.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Separate between independent and dependent events. The probability that an airplane navigation system works is 99% and the probability that the backup navigation system works is 90%. The probability that the backup system fails is not influenced by whether the primary system fails or not. The probability that neither navigation system works is one tenth of a percent (0.0lx0.1). Navigation system reliability is therefore 99.9% (at least one navigation system will work).</p>
        <p class="calibre2">But if the systems are dependent - the probability of the backup failing rises</p>

        <p class="calibre2">161</p>
        <p class="calibre2">if the primary system fails - the overall probability of a system failure increases. We can't assume that events are independent of each other. What happens next in a chain of events may not be independent of the previous outcome. Subsystems may share something in common. For example, aircraft engines draw fuel from a common supply and a common pump. Dependence can also be caused by the fact that parts are of the same design, manufactured by the same company.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Unlikely things happen if enough time passes. <span>An </span>event that has one chance in 20 of happening in any given year (assume that the probability stay the same over time) is nearly certain to happen over 50 years (92.3%). <span>If </span>we reduce the probability to one chance in 40, the probability of the event happening at least once over 50 years is decreased to 71.8%.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Suppose there are 40 independent ways for a nuclear accident to happen in any given year, each with a probability of 1 in 1000. The probability that an accident happens in any given year is 3.9%. The probability that at least one nuclear accident happens during the next 10 years is 33%.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">We might reduce the probability of accidents, but not eliminate them.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">Based on frequency and scientific data, scientists estimated in 2003 that there is a 62% probability (the error range could be anywhere from 38 to 87%) of at least one magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake, striking somewhere in the Bay region before 2032. The probability of a major earthquake happening in any given year is therefore 3.2% (assuming the probability of a major earthquake happening in any given year stays the same). The probability that a major earthquake will happen at least once during the next 5 years is 15%.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Regardless of the factors that are considered in predicting earthquakes, chance plays a role in whether a large earthquake happens.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Can we predict the time, location and magnitude of a future earthquake? Berkeley Statistics Professors David Freedman and Philip Stark say in their report <span>What is the chance of an earthquake </span>that a larger earthquake in the Bay Area is inevitable, and imminent in geologic time: "Probabilities are a distraction. Instead of making forecasts, the USGS [U.S. Geological Survey] could help to improve building codes and to plan the government's response to the next large earthquake. Bay Area residents should take reasonable precautions, including bracing and bolting their homes as well a securing water heaters, bookcases, and other heavy objects. They should keep first aid supplies, water, and food at hand. They should largely ignore the USGS probability forecast."</p>

        <p class="calibre2">Even if the probability that some technology works is 99.99%, human fallibility makes the system less reliable than technological reliability alone. Humans are involved in designing, execution and follow-up. Excluding ignorance and insufficient knowledge, given the complexity of human and non-human factors interacting, there is a multitude of ways in which things can go wrong.</p>

For example, a surgeon leaving a metal instrument in a patient's abdomen, a patient having the wrong leg amputated, a cardiac surgeon bypassing the wrong artery, a doctor prescribing the wrong drug, a missed diagnosis of complete heart block, a missed colon cancer, a wrong diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, or a blood product being mislabeled.</p>

The study showed that 3.7% of patients (negligence accounting for 1%) had complications that either prolonged their hospital stay or resulted in disability. Later studies have shown that medical errors account for between 44,000 to 98,000 deaths in the U.S. every year and that medication errors are the leading eighth cause of death.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">A study of 100 cases of diagnostic errors in internal medicine showed that system-related factors contributed in 65% of the cases and cognitive factors in 74%. Cognitive and system-related factors often co-occurred.

        <p class="calibre2">Henry Ford said: "Don't find fault, find a remedy." Don't assign blame. Look for causes and preventive methods. Often it is better to prevent future errors by designing safety into systems than punishing individuals for past error. Blame does little to improve safety or prevent others from making the same mistake. For example, aviation assumes that errors of judgment happen and that it is better to seek out causes than assign blame. That is why the Federal Aviation Administration (FM) has an Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) for analyzing and reporting aviation incidents. FM utilizes NASA as a third party to receive aviation safety reports. This cooperation invites pilots to report to NASA actual or potential deficiencies involving aviation safety. That NASA is the receiver ensures confidentiality and anonymity of the reporter and all parties involved in an incident. There has been no breach of confidentiality in more than 20 years of the ASRS under NASA management. Pilots who report an incident within ten days have automatic immunity from punishment.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">Ancient Rome used incentives in the design and construction of safe bridges. The designer of the bridge had to stand under it after completion while chariots drove over the top. This put both the designer's life and those who used the bridge at risk. This increased the probability that designers made sure the bridge held up. Engineers and architects add a safety factor to accommodate uncertainty.

        <p class="calibre2">Assume that accidents will happen and prepare for when people and technology don't work as planned. Systems should be designed to eliminate the probability of bad events or limit their consequences if they happen. We can borrow an idea from aviation where incidents are thoroughly investigated to learn what went wrong and how to do better next time - critical incident analysis. Ask: How do specific accidents evolve? What major factors contribute? Are there any common patterns? We need to add a factor of safety for known and unknown risks. We have to consider break points, build in defense systems and contingency plans. We must also simplify and standardize equipment and processes and use checklists to</p>

        <p class="calibre2">The probability that some roll contains any five specified numbers is very small or one in 7,776 (for example, 6x6x6x6x6). When we toss five dice there are precisely 7,776 different combinations of numbers that can appear. Every combination is equally likely and one of them is certain to happen every time we roll five dice. Even if one particular combination (five sixes) is improbable, no single combination is impossible. Any combination that happens is simply one out of a number of equally likely outcomes. It may have been improbable that John rolled five sixes, but not impossible.</p>

No, Mary forgot about all the times Jill didn't call when Mary was thinking about her, or the times someone else called, or the times Jill called but Mary wasn't thinking of her, or the times Jill didn't call when Mary wasn't thinking of her. When Mary thinks about Jill and the phone rings, it registers as an event and something we remember. When Jill doesn't call, it is a non-event. Nothing happened.

        <p class="calibre2">Hume suggests the following test: <span>If </span>the opposite of a given statement is more</p>
        <p class="calibre2">likely, the statement is probably false. Thus, isn't it more likely that the opposite, <span>"Alice didn't witness a miracle" </span>is true?

        <p class="calibre2">The German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe said: "Mysteries are not necessarily miracles." That an event can't be explained doesn't mean it is a miracle.

        <p class="calibre2">Does eyewitness identification or DNA evidence mean that a person is guilty? Does a positive medical test mean that a person has a disease?</p>
        <p class="calibre2">In the eighteenth century, the English mathematician and minister Thomas Bayes laid a foundation for a method of evaluating evidence. The French mathematician Pierre Simon de Laplace brought the method to its modern form. Bayes' Theorem makes it possible to update the prior probability of an outcome in light of new evidence. <span>It </span>is easier to use if we change probability formats into frequency formats. Let's use Bayes's Theorem with a modified version of the classic cab problem,</p>
        <p class="calibre2">originally developed by the Psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky.</p>

John said "green" in 8 out of 10 cases when something was green and said "green" 2 times out of 10 when something was blue. This means that John misidentified the color 2 out of 10 times.</span></p>
        <p class="calibre2">How trustworthy is John as an eyewitness? A witness testimony always</p>

        <p class="calibre2">contains a degree of uncertainty. Also remember that the reliability of any observation not only depends on the reliability of the observer - even if John has good eyes - but also on how likely his observation is true given prior probabilities. First we ask: What is the prior probability ofoutcome- how probable is an event prior to considering the new evidence? How probable is it that a green cab was involved in an accident before we consider John's evidence? Assume that the relative frequency (the proportion of cabs of a certain color in a particular population at a specific point in time) of blue and green cabs gives us information about the prior probability of involvement in the accident. What was the proportion of blue and green cabs out of all cabs at the time of the accident? Assume there were a total of 100 cabs in town. 90 blue and 10 green. This means that the prior probability the</p>
        <p class="calibre2">cab involved was green is 10% (10 green cabs out of 100).</p>
        <p class="calibre2">What is the (posterior - after considering case evidence) probability the cab was green given that John said it was green?</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">If <span>10 out of 100 cabs are green and John is right 8 out of 10 times, then he identifies 8 cabs as green. IfJohn says green cab and it is not a green cab then he is likely to identify 18 of the 80 blue cabs as green. Out of a total of 26 cabs John has identified as green, only 8 are green. This means that the likelihood that the cab was green given John's testimony that "the cab was green" is 31 % (8/26). It seems the cab involved is more likely to have been blue.</span></p>
        <p class="calibre2">Before John testified the prior probability was only 10% that the cab involved was green. When he testified "green" the probability rose to 31%.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">"Based on 50 years of accidents involving cabs, given the same proportion of color, 3 out of 4 times the cab involved was green. <span>"</span></p>
        <p class="calibre2">Independent of the frequency of blue and green cabs, the appropriate prior probability may have been past evidence of accidents. What we want is the correct evidence that is representative for what was likely to happen before we considered the new evidence.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">When we get new representative evidence, we must update the prior probability. Ask: What has happened in similar cases in the past? Are there any reasons this probability should be revised? Have the circumstances or the environment changed? The more uncertainty that surrounds a specific case, the more emphasis we must put on the prior probability.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">How strong is the evidence?</p>
        <p class="calibre2">One factor when evaluating evidence is the coincidental or random match probability. <span>It </span>answers the question: What is the probability that a person other than the suspect, randomly selected, will match a certain profile? For example, when evaluating DNA evidence a random match happens when two different people share the same DNA profile.</p>

          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">After five days of searching, the police found the missing woman strangled to death. john's brother, Bill, is on trial for her murder.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">There is a DNA profile match. The forensic evidence against Bill is blood and tissue samples taken from the crime scene, which match Bill's. Either Bill left the evidence or someone else did.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">What is the probability of a coincidental match? How likely is it that a match occurs between the DNA profile found at the scene of the murder and a randomly chosen person? How likely is it that Bill's profile matches the profile of the person who did leave the evidence at the crime scene? How rare is this profile? The rarer the profile, the lower the probability that Bill's matches only by chance. The prosecution's medical expert witness estimates (estimation of the frequency of the profile in the most appropriate comparison population) the probability that there would be such a match if Bill was innocent and the match was just a coincidence as only 1 in 20,000. This means that out of every 20,000 individuals, only one will have the same DNA profile as the one found at the murder scene. The prosecutor argues: <span>"There is only a one in 20,000 chance that someone other than Bill would by chance have the same profile as the one found on the murder scene. The probability is therefore only 1 in 20,000 that someone other than Bill left the evidence. </span>"The figure had a dramatic impact on the media and</p>
        <p class="calibre2">the jury. Bill was found guilty and given a life sentence.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Where did justice go wrong? The prosecutor confused two probabilities. The probability that Bill is innocent given a match is not the same as the probability of a match given Bill is innocent. The prosecutor should have said: <span>"The probability is one in 20,000 that some person other than Bill would leave the same blood and tissue as that found on the crime scene. </span><span>"</span></p>
        <p class="calibre2">The jury also needs to consider prior (before the evaluation of the forensic evidence is considered) probabilities of guilt. The probability that Bill is the murderer can't only be calculated from the forensic evidence alone. Other evidence needs to be considered. The significance of forensic evidence always depends on other evidence. What other data do the police have? What else is known about Bill? Does he have an alibi? Was he near the crime scene? Each piece</p>
        <p class="calibre2">

        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">171</p>
        <p class="calibre2">of evidence must be considered together, and not in isolation. There may also have been a non-criminal explanation of why Bill left the blood and tissue samples.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Based on evidence prior to considering the forensic evidence the jury estimates there is a 10% probability that Bill is the source of the forensic evidence (90% that he is not and thus innocent). The probability of a match given Bill is guilty is 1 (sensitivity 100% i.e. no false negatives) because if Bill is the source of the forensic evidence and the laboratory test is accurate, his DNA profile will match. Combining this with the random match probability of one chance in 20,000 (that his DNA profile showed up at the crime scene just by chance) gives a posterior probability that Bill is the source of the forensic evidence of 99.96% (0.1/0.100045).</p>

          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">One way of determining the prior probability is by asking: What is the population from which the murderer could have come? We need to know the appropriate comparison population to estimate this number. The murder has taken place in a city of 500,000 men. Assume any man in the city could have committed the crime. One of them is the murderer. Of the 499,999 people innocent, we can expect about 25 coincidental DNA matches. This means there are 26 men (25 <span>+ </span>the murderer) who could have committed the crime. Since Bill is one of these 26, the probability that he is guilty given the forensic evidence, is only 3.8% (1/26).</p>
        <p class="calibre2">But is this really true? It is only true if all men are equally likely to have committed the crime. For example, that they all had the same access to the crime scene.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">The choice of appropriate comparison population also matters. How did the expert witness estimate the random match probability? What is the real prevalence of this profile? And does the random match probability mean that this profile would occur only once in 20,000 individuals? No, the calculated frequency is only an estimate that may be wrong in either direction.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">DNA evidence is also easier to plant at a crime scene than for example fingerprints (DNA evidence is easier to manufacture or distort). In <span>Scientific Conversations </span>by Claudia Dreifus, forensic mathematician Charles Brenner says about the O.J. Simpson case and DNA evidence: "The defense did something very clever from the DNA point of view: They said the evidence was planted. Their basic strategy was even if it matches, it was a plant. They gave up on the</p>
        <p class="calibre2">
          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">172</p>
        <p class="calibre2">strategy of disproving the DNA evidence. There obviously was a match in the blood. They never denied it."</p>
        <p class="calibre2">In the O.J. Simpson trial, the defense argued that fewer than one out of 1,000 wife abusers kill their wives. Therefore evidence of abuse is irrelevant and should not be admissible in a murder trial. But the appropriate probability is not the probability that a man who abuses his wife kills her. The relevant comparison population to consider is wives who have been abused by their husbands and thereafter been murdered by someone. The relevant question is therefore: What is the probability that a man killed his wife given that he abused her and given that she was actually killed by someone? And Nicole Brown Simpson was killed, not just abused.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">John Allen Paulos says in <span>Innumeracy </span>that given reasonable facts about murder and abuse, it has been shown that if a man abuses his wife or girlfriend and she is later killed, the abuser is the killer more than 80 percent of the time. But this doesn't mean that the probability that the husband or boyfriend is guilty of murder is 80%. It is just one piece of evidence among many that needs <span>to </span>be considered.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">Do errors happen in testing?</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Yes, one type of error is a false positive and another is a false negative. A false positive is akin <span>to </span>a false alarm. A false negative is the missing of a real effect. For example, some factors that can influence the reliability of medical test results and cause false positives are: the clinical accuracy of the test method (compared with some "gold standard"), patient preparation, medical conditions, medications and laboratory errors. People may also make errors when collecting and handling samples, in their interpretation of test results or in reporting test results correctly.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">john tested positive for a rare disease with a mortality rate of BO%. How scared should he be?</p>
        <p class="calibre2">What is the chance that anyone (a person chosen randomly and belonging <span>to </span>the same risk group as John) actually has the disease given that they tested positive? The predictive value of the test depends both on the clinical accuracy of the test and prior probabilities or the proportion of individuals with the disease in the population we are testing at agiven time (prevalence). Clinical accuracy is composed of sensitivity (the frequency of positive test that results in positive samples) and</p>
        <p class="calibre2">specificity (the frequency of negative test that results in negative samples).</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Assume a population of 100,000 people.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">The frequency of people with the disease in the population is 0.1 % i.e. one person in 1,000 has the disease. Before the test John had a 0.1% chance of having</p>

          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">173</p>
        <p class="calibre2">the disease and a 99.9 % chance of not having the disease. <span>If </span>the test was 100% accurate, 100 people should test positive and 99,900 should test negative. These are the prior probabilities.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">The test has a 97% sensitivity or true positive rate. This means that 97 out of 100 people with the disease correctly test positive. <span>It </span>also means that 3 people out of 100 with the disease wrongly test negative (false negatives).</p>
        <p class="calibre2">The test has a 95% specificity or true negative rate. This means that 95 out of 100 people without the disease correctly test negative. 5% of the time the test is incorrect. 5% of the people without the disease or 4,995 people wrongly test positive (false positives).</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Since John is told he tested positive, the information he needs is the frequency of people that test positive and have the disease (true positives) and the frequency of people that test positive but don't have the disease (false positives).</p>

        <p class="calibre2">Out of every 1,000 people belonging to the same risk group as John, we can expect that 19 people have the deadly disease given they test positive (97/5,092). The probability that John has the deadly disease given he tested positive is about 1.9% or very low. Out of 5,092 tests, most are false positives indicating the disease when there is no disease.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">What if a randomly tested person tests negative? There are 3 false negatives and 94,905 true negatives, meaning that there is more than a 99.9% chance that the person doesn't have the disease.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">The label "tested positive" can be scary but remember that the test is not the disease. A test could fall in the group of false positives. But which is worst? To belong to the group of false positives - diagnosed as having the disease without having it, or false negatives - diagnosed as not having the disease but having it? The higher the prior probability or the more common a disease, the more reliable the outcome of the test. Conversely, the lower the prior probability or the more rare the disease, the less reliable the outcome of the test. Even a highly accurate test can yield an unreliable result if it tests for a rather uncommon disease. This assumes that the individual tested does not belong to a group of</p>
        <p class="calibre2">people at higher risk of having the disease.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Ask: What is the frequency of people with the disease in the relevant comparison population before I consider specific case evidence? How accurate is the medical test?</p>

        <p class="calibre2">The above reasoning can be used to help evaluate the reliability of diagnostic tests or screening procedures. Some examples are screening for or diagnosis of breast cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, HIV or drug use.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Estimating the frequency of false positives and false negatives are also important when evaluating the reliability of polygraph tests (used in criminal investigations or for screening employees) and identification systems.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">In <span>polygraph tests, false positives occur when innocent persons are found deceptive. False negatives occur when guilty persons are found non-deceptive.</span></p>
        <p class="calibre2">In <span>identification systems, a false positive occurs when a system accepts a match where there is none. A false negative occurs when a system fails to recognize a match where there is one.</span></p>
        <p class="calibre2">The probability of false positives is also a factor to consider when evaluating the value of DNA profile evidence. This means that the jury in Bill's case also needs to consider the false positive rate. The jury needs to ask: What is the probability that the laboratory reports a match between two samples that don't match? A reported match doesn't necessarily mean a true match. Errors happen. A possible explanation for the forensic match may be error due to contamination (accidental or deliberate), mishandling the evidence, or switching the samples. For example, in one rape case, technicians from the Houston police crime laboratory told the jury that they found a DNA match between a rapist's DNA and a male suspect. The man was convicted in 1999 and sent to prison for 25 years. In 2003, the Houston Police Department said that the DNA was not from the convicted man.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">When evaluating case evidence we must consider the prior probability, the</p>
        <p class="calibre2">probability of a random match, and the probability of a false positive.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">Bertrand Russell said in <i class="calibre4">Problems of Philosophy: </i>"The man who has fed the chicken every day throughout its life at last wrings its neck instead." Often the past is a good guide to the future - but not always. Statistics are a record of the past, not a prediction of the future. We can't automatically assume that the future will mirror the past. Processes and circumstances change. Warren Buffett says: "Conditions relating to technology and all aspects of human behavior can make the future a lot different than the past."</p>
        <p class="calibre2">We need to consider changes in conditions before using past evidence to predict likely future outcomes. For example, it's in the nature of businesses and economic conditions to change. Competition and demand changes. <span>If </span>there are more ways for creating competition or less demand, we have to change the equation. Ask: Why was past experience the way it was? What reason is there to suppose that the future will resemble the past? Has the environment changed? Are the conditions similar? Are the context and circumstances that caused the past still present?</p>
        <p class="calibre2">We also make mistakes if we ignore that past performance may have been achieved under far different circumstances than today. As Warren Buffett says, "The same mistake that a baseball manager would were he to judge the future prospects of a 42-year-old center fielder on the basis of his lifetime batting average." Management performance may also be conditioned on environment. What makes an individual successful in one environment does not guarantee success in</p>
        <p class="calibre2">another. Ask: What is the company's or manager's ability to handle adversity?</p>

There may also be technological improvements in the collection and reporting of data. There may also be business incentives at work.

        <p class="calibre2">Four out of five doctors recommend the drug.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">This statement doesn't tell us anything if we don't know how many doctors were observed. Maybe it was just 1O; an observation that can't be extrapolated to include all doctors. A small sample size has no predictive value. The smaller the sample is, the more statistical fluctuations and the more likely it is that we find chance events. We need a representative comparison group, large enough sample size, and long enough periods of time.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Small samples can cause us to believe a risk is lower or higher than reality. Why? A small sample increases the chance that we won't find a particular relationship where it exists or find one where it doesn't exist.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Consider evidence that describes what happens in most similar situations or to most people.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Sometimes a track record is not a good indicator of what is likely to happen in the future. <span>It </span>may show up by luck. Imagine a room filled with 1,000 monkeys. Each is trying to predict the direction (up or down) of interest rates. At the end of 10 predictions, one monkey has a perfect record of predicting the direction of interest rates. He is considered agenius and the greatest economist in history. Even if it was just by chance. <span>As </span>soon as we have a large population of forecasters that predict events where chance plays a role, someone will be right, get press coverage and be presented as a hero. He will hold lectures and give sensible explanations.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Sometimes we only see the good performers. Partly because winners have a tendency to show up (one monkey). Losers don't (999 monkeys). Often we aren't interested in the losers anyway. But we shouldn't be amazed to see winners if there is a large population <span>to </span>choose from. 10,000 monkeys and we find 10 geniuses. When we measure performance we must consider both the number of successes (one monkey), the number of failures (999 monkeys), and the size of the relevant comparison population they came from (1,000 monkeys). The more people (or monkeys), involved in something where chance plays a role, the more likely it is that some people have great performances just by chance. <span>An </span>exception is in a group of high performers where we  can observe some common</p>
        <p class="calibre2">characteristics that may be a causal factor and not luck.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">The same mistakes may happen when people base their conclusions on mere effects and ignore the influence of chance. Think about 100 monkeys. They each roll a die once.

        <p class="calibre2">Ignoring failures</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Evidence must be drawn from the frequency of both success and failure over time. Often we only consider the successful and supporting outcomes. The epidemiological literature refers to this as survival bias. Only the characteristics of the survivors of a disease or outcome under study are included in the study. Those who have died before the end of the study are excluded. <span>If </span>these are patients with more severe risk factors, the study reduces an apparent association between risk factors and outcomes. Survival bias is also common in all studies made after the outcomes have occurred (including back testing). They only focus on surviving cases or patients. The people who have died are not in the sampling pool. People may also select or omit certain information by only publishing positive outcomes and omitting negative ones.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">If <span>we only study successes or survivors, a performance record may look better than it really is. Charles Munger says that we give too little attention to failures:</span></p>

        <p class="calibre2">It <span>is assumed by many business school graduates, and by almost all consultants, that a corporation can easily improve its outcome by purchasing unrelated or tenuously related businesses.

        <p class="calibre2">Our experience, both actual and vicarious, makes us less optimistic about easy solutions through business acquisition. We think undue optimism arises because successful records draw too much attention.

What we mean by variability is how much the individual outcomes are spread out from the average outcome. The more spread out, the more variability. <span>Ask: </span>What has happened in the past?

        <p class="calibre2">The normal distribution curve shows a frequency distribution of outcomes and may sometimes help us find the most frequent outcomes and the variations. There are many ways a set of outcomes can be spread out or distributed. But some outcomes are more frequent than others. Many characteristics resulting from independent random factors have a bell-shaped frequency distribution. This means that the most frequent outcomes will be in the middle of the distribution, and the other outcomes will fall on either side of the middle. The</p>
        <p class="calibre2">further away any outcome is from the middle, the less frequent it is.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Examples of normally distributed outcomes are heights or weights of adults (which depend on factors such as genes, diet, or environment), temperatures, car accidents, mortality rates, or the length of life of a light bulb.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">If <span>we randomly select one thousand adult females and measure their height, we end up with a distribution of outcomes that look like a bell-shaped curve. Their heights will center around their average height, and the breadth of the curve indicates how variable around this average the heights are. Adding one extremely tall woman to a large sample doesn't really change the average height.</span></p>
        <p class="calibre2">The same reasoning can be applied to an auto insurance company. The more of the same game the insurance company plays, the better the average becomes as a guide. Adding an extremely expensive car accident doesn't really change this. The average is representative and has predictive power.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">But we can't use the normal distribution curve for those classes of insurance that involve mammoth and unusual risks. For an insurance company specializing in insuring unique events, the possible variability in outcomes is key.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">In many cases, the normal distribution curve may not give us a true picture of reality. One single favorable or unfavorable extreme event can have a large impact and dramatically change the averages. We saw examples of this uneven type of distribution earlier with size and frequency. The less number of times or the shorter the time or the more impact a single event may have on the average, the more important it is to consider the variability, and the more unpredictable some factor becomes. For example, suppose the average sales of books are</p>
        <p class="calibre2">$200,000. But if our sample contains one extreme best-seller (the <span>Harry Potter</span></p>

        <p class="calibre2">only see what the biggest hurricane was in the documented past.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">We can't use past statistics to predict these rare and high-impact events. We don't know their timing, frequency, or degree of impact.

Also, many events are not independent but are instead interconnected. Financial markets are one example; markets have memories, assets may be correlated and one bad event may cause another.

        <p class="calibre2">A business executive tells us that his company had average earnings of $50 million over the last 3 years. But when we look closer we find great variability and a downward trend in the performance record: 1998: $100 million, 1999: $50 million, 2000: $0.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">In 1982, Stephen jay Gould was diagnosed with a rare and deadly form of cancer with a median mortality of 8 months after discovery. He beat the cancer for 20 years. <span>Does an 8 month median mortality mean that a person will be dead in 8 months? Gould learned that an 8 month median mortality means half the people die before 8 months and half will live longer. But he found that there was a wider spread of outcomes after 8 months than before. This makes sense since there is a lower limit to the spread of outcomes during an 8 month period than after 8 months. No person will die before the start of the 8 month period but those who survive can live considerably longer than 8 months. We can't treat the average or the median as the most likely outcome for any single individual. Look at the variation between all outcomes. This means that a treatment ought to be determined based on whether an individual is likely to have an outcome better or worse than the median.</span></p>

        <p class="calibre2">Effects of regression</p>
        <p class="calibre2">"Regression to the mean" is a notion worked out by Sir Francis Galton (Charles Darwin's first cousin). It says that, in any series of events where chance is involved, very good or bad performances, high or low scores, extreme events, etc. tend on the average, <span>to </span>be followed by more average performance or less extreme events. <span>If </span>we do extremely well, we're likely to do worse the next time, while if we do poorly, we're likely to do better the next time. But regression to the mean is not a natural law. Merely a statistical tendency. And it may take a long time before it happens.</p>

          <a id="calibre_link-228">Dissatisfied with the new employees' performance, John put them into a skill enhancing program. He measures the employees' skills at the end of the program.</a>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">Their scores are now higher than they were on the first test. John's conclusion: "The skill-enhancing program caused the improvement in skill." This isn't necessarily true. Their higher scores could be the result of regression to the mean. Since these individuals were measured as being on the low end of the scale of skill, they would have shown an improvement even if they hadn't taken the skill-enhancing program. And there could be many reasons for their earlier performance - stress, fatigue, sickness, distraction, etc. Their true ability perhaps hasn't changed.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Our performance always varies around some average true performance. Extreme performance tends to get less extreme the next time. Why? Testing measurements can never be exact. All measurements are made up of one true part and one random error part. When the measurements are extreme, they are likely to be partly caused by chance. Chance is likely to contribute less on the second time we measure performance.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">If <span>we switch from one way of doing something to another merely because we</span></p>
        <p class="calibre2">are unsuccessful, it's very likely that we do better the next time even if the new way of doing something is equal or worse.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Part Two and Three dealt with reasons for misjudgments and ideas for reducing them. Before we enter Part Four let's conclude with how we can learn from past mistakes.</p>

How can we understand what is happening to us without any reference to the past? We conveniently forget to record our mistakes. But they should be highlighted. We should confess our errors and learn from them. We should look into their causes and take steps to prevent them from happening again. <span>Ask:</span></p>

            </p>
            <p class="calibre2">You tend to forget your own mistakes when reputation is threatened by remembering. For that very reason, one very wise company - Johnson &amp; Johnson - has a system whereby two years or so after they've made some big acquisition they have a post-mortem. And they bring back the original projections and the original reasons for doing the deal. They identify the people who made the arguments and what have you. Then they compare them with how the deal worked out.</p>

            <p class="calibre2">
              <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
            </p>
            <p class="calibre2">Managers tend to be reluctant to look at the results of the capital projects or the acquisitions that they proposed with great detail only a year or two earlier to a board. And they don't want to actually stick the figures up there as <span>to </span>how the reality worked out relative to the projections. That's human nature.</p>
            <p class="calibre2">But I think you're a better doctor if you drop by the pathology department occasionally. And I think you're a better manager or investor if you look at each decision that you've made of importance and see which ones worked out and which ones didn't - and figure your batting average. Then, if your batting average gets too bad, you better hand the decision-making over to someone else.</p>
            <p class="calibre2">
              <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
            </p>
            <p class="calibre2">We could also use pre-mortems to help us anticipate problems and key vulnerabilities. For example, before making an important decision, imagine a failure where things really have gone wrong and ask: What could have caused this?</p>

When Charles Munger was asked what would be the best question he should ask himself, he said:</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2"><span>If</span>you ask not about investment matters, but about your personal lives, I think the best question is, "Is there anything I can do <span>to </span>make my whole life and my whole mental process work better?"</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2">189</p><p class="calibre2"><a id="calibre_link-236">And I would say that developing the habit of mastering the multiple models which underlie reality is the best thing you can do.. .It's just so much fun - and it works so well.</a></p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2">A model is an idea that helps us better understand how the world works. Models illustrate consequences and answer questions like "why" and "how". Take the model of social proof as an example. What happens? When people are uncertain they often automatically do what others do without thinking about the correct thing to do. This idea helps explain "why" and predict "how" people are likely to behave in certain situations.</p><p class="calibre2">Models help us avoid problems. Assume that we are told that the earth consists of infinite resources. By knowing the idea about limits, we know the statement is false. Someone gives us an investment proposal about a project that contradicts the laws of physics. How much misery can be avoided by staying away from whatever doesn't make scientific sense?</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2">What characterizes a useful model?</p><p class="calibre2">If <span>a model agrees with reality, it is most likely true. One idea from biology that agrees with reality is that "people on average act out of self-interest." But not the idea that "people's personalities can be evaluated by using the Rorschach ink-blot test." It can't predict people's personalities. Ask: What is the underlying big idea? Do I understand its application in practical life? Does it help me understand the world? How does it work? Why does it work? Under what conditions does it work? How reliable is it? What are its limitations? How does it relate to other models?</span></p><p class="calibre2">Charles Munger gives an example of a useful idea from chemistry - autocatalysis:</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2"><span>If </span>you get a certain kind of process going in chemistry, it speeds up on its <span>own. </span>So you get this marvelous <span>boost </span>in what you're trying to do that runs on and on. Now, the laws of physics are such that it doesn't run on <i class="calibre4">forever. </i>But it runs on for a goodly while. So you get a huge boost. You accomplish A- and, all of a sudden, you're getting A+ B + C for awhile.</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2">He continues telling us how this idea can be applied:</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2">Disney is an amazing example of autocatalysis ... They <span>had </span>all those movies in the can. They owned the copyright. And just as Coke could prosper when refrigeration came, when the videocassette was invented, Disney didn't have <span>to </span>invent anything or do anything except take the thing out of the can and stick it on the cassette.</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2">190</p><p class="calibre2"><a id="calibre_link-237">Which models are most reliable? Charles Munger answers:</a></p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2">The models that come from hard science and engineering are the most reliable models on this Earth. And engineering quality control - at least the guts of it that matters to you and me and people who are not professional engineers - is very much based on the elementary mathematics of Fermat and Pascal: <span>It </span>costs so much and you get so much less likelihood of it breaking if you spend this much ...</p><p class="calibre2">And, of course, the engineering idea of a backup system is a very powerful idea. The engineering idea ofbreakpoints- that's avery powerful model, too. The notion of a critical mass - that comes out of physics - is a very powerful model.</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2">A valuable model produces meaningful explanations and predictions oflikely future consequences where the cost of being wrong is high.</p><p class="calibre2">A model should be easy to use. <span>If </span>it is complicated, we don't use it.</p><p class="calibre2">It is useful on a nearly daily basis. <span>If </span>it is not used, we forget it. And what use is knowledge if we don't use it?</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2">Considering many ideas help us achieve a holistic view</p><p class="calibre2">Those who love wisdom must be inquirers into many things indeed.</p><ul id="calibre_link-238" class="calibre13"><li class="calibre6"><p class="calibre2">Heraclitus</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2">What can help us see the big picture? How can we consider many aspects of an issue? Use knowledge and insights from many disciplines. Most problems need to be studied from a variety of perspectives. Charles Munger says, "In most messy human problems, you have to be able to use <span>all </span>the big ideas and not just a few of them."</p><p class="calibre2">The world is multidisciplinary. Physics doesn't explain everything; neither does biology or economics. For example, in a business it is useful to know how scale changes behavior, how systems may break, how supply influences prices, and how incentives cause behavior.</p><p class="calibre2">Since no single discipline has all the answers, we need to understand and use the big ideas from all the important disciplines - mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering, biology, psychology, and rank and use them in order of their reliability. Charles Munger illustrates the importance of this:</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2">Suppose you want <span>to </span>be good at declarer play in contract bridge. Well, you know the contract - you know what you have to achieve. And you can count up the sure winners you have by laying down your high cards and your invincible trumps.</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2">191</p><p class="calibre2">But if you're a trick or two short, how are you going to get the other needed tricks? Well, there are only six or so different, standard methods: You've got long-suit establishment. You've got finesses. You've got throw-in plays. You've got cross-ruffs. You've got squeezes. And you've got various ways of misleading the defense into making errors. So it's a very limited number of models. But if you only know one or two of those models, then you're going to be a horse's patoot in declarer play...</p><p class="calibre2"><span>If </span>you <span>don't </span>have the full repertoire, I guarantee you that you'll overutilize the limited</p><p class="calibre2">repertoire you have - including use of models that are inappropriate just because they're available to you in the limited stock you have in mind.</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2">Suppose we have a problem and ask: What can explain this? How can we achieve this? How can we then use different ideas? Charles Munger tells us how to do it:</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2">Have a full kit of tools... go through them in your mind checklist-sryle... you can never make any explanation that can be made in a more fundamental way in any other way than the most fundamental way. And you always take with full attribution to the most fundamental ideas that you are required to use. When you're using physics, you say you're using physics. When you're using biology, you say you're using biology.</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2">We also need to understand how different ideas interact and combine. Charles Munger says:</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2">You get <span>lollapalooza </span>effects when two, three or four forces are all operating in the same direction. And, frequently, you don't get simple addition. It's often like a critical mass in physics where you get a nuclear <span>explosion </span>if you get to a certain point of mass - and you don't get anything much worth seeing if you <span>don't </span>reach the mass.</p><p class="calibre2">Sometimes the forces just add like ordinary quantities and sometimes they combine on a break-point or critical-mass basis... More commonly, the forces coming out of... models are <span>conflicting </span>to some extent. And you get huge, miserable trade-offs ... So you [must] have the <span>models </span>and you [must] see the <span>relatedness </span>and the effects from the relatedness.</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2">The British mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead said: "The problem of education is to make the pupil see the wood by means of the trees." We need <span>to </span>consider many aspects of an issue and synthesize and integrate them. We need <span>to </span>understand how it all fits together <span>to </span>form a coherent whole. The term synthesis comes from classical Greek and means literally "to put together." Below are some examples of how this can be used in problem-solving.</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2">192</p><p class="calibre2"><a id="calibre_link-239">We can combine ideas within a discipline.

The modern evolutionary synthesis was a unification of several ideas within biology.</p><p class="calibre2">We can combine ideas from different disciplines. The ideas of scaling from mathematics, systems and constraints from physics, and competitive advantage from microeconomics often explain how business value is created or destroyed.</p><p class="calibre2">We can try to see relationships between phenomena, and try to find one principle that can explain them all. The British physicist James Clark Maxwell combined in one model the laws of electricity and magnetism with the laws of behavior of light. This single model explained optical, electrical and magnetic phenomena.</p><p class="calibre2">We can find similarities or functional equivalents within or between disciplines. The functional equivalent of viscosity from chemistry is stickiness in economics.</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2">How can we learn an idea so <span>it </span>sticks in our memory?</p><p class="calibre2">Samuel Johnson said: "He is a benefactor of mankind who contracts the great rules of life into short sentences, that may be easily impressed on the memory, and so recur habitually to the mind."</p><p class="calibre2">Richard Feynman answered the following question in one of his physics lectures:</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2">If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were <span>to </span>be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the <span>atomic hypothesis </span>(or the atomic fact, or whatever you wish <span>to </span>call it) that <span>all things are made ofatoms </span><span>- </span><span>little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they area little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. </span>In that one sentence, you will see, there is an <span>enormous </span>amount of information about the world, if just a little imagination and thinking are applied.</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2">We can use the Feynman "one sentence explanation" when dealing with big ideas. "What sentence contains the most information in the fewest words?" An example of a one-sentence idea from psychology is: "We get what we reward for." A sentence from physics is: "Energy is neither created nor destroyed - only changed from one form into another."</p><p class="calibre2">Another way to understand a model is to give it a "hook."

For example to</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2">193</p><p class="calibre2"><a id="calibre_link-240">remember social proof, we can think about the Genovese homicide in New York City (see Part Two).</a></p><p class="calibre2">A Chinese proverb says, "I forget what I hear; I remember what I see; I know what I do." Since the best way to learn something is by doing it, we must apply models routinely to different situations. Like any skill, this takes both practice and discipline.</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2">Search for explanations</p><p class="calibre2">What happens and why does it happen?</p><p class="calibre2">One way of forcing us to learn models to better deal with reality is to open our eyes and look at the things we see around us and ask "why" things are happening (or why things are not happening). Take some simple examples as "why do apples fall downward?" or "why do we fall down when we slip?" or "why don't we fall off the earth?" The English mathematician and physicist Sir Isaac Newton's law of gravitation can explain this.</p><p class="calibre2">Newton's 1st law tells us that an object in motion tends to continue in motion at a steady speed in a straight line, and an object at rest tends to stay at rest, unless the object is acted upon by an outside force.</p><p class="calibre2">This means that there are only 3 ways to change an object: an object at rest can start to move, an object in motion at a steady speed can go up or down in speed, and an object in motion in a straight line can change direction. And what is needed to change an object's motion? A force.</p><p class="calibre2">All change in motion happens in response to the action of force(s). By forces, we mean a push or a pull that acts on an object. When we open a door or throw a baseball, we are using forces (muscular effort). Almost everything we do involves forces.</p><p class="calibre2">Newton's 2nd law tells us that force is the product of mass and acceleration. Acceleration is any change in speed and/or direction. It depends on the mass (measures an object power to resist change in its state of motion) of an object and the magnitude and direction of the force acting on it. The more force we use at a given mass, the greater the acceleration. But the more mass, the more an object resists acceleration. For example, the more force we use to throw a baseball, the greater the acceleration of the ball. <span>If </span>we increase mass, we have to add more force to produce the same rate of acceleration.</p><p class="calibre2">Newton's 3rd law is that forces work in pairs. One object exerts a force on a second object, but the second object also exerts a force equal and opposite in direction to the force acting on it - the first object. <span>As </span>Newton said in <span>Philosophiae Natura/is Principia Mathematica: </span><span>"If </span>you press a stone with your</p><p class="calibre2">194</p><p class="calibre2">finger, the finger is also pressed by the stone." <span>If </span>we throw a baseball, the ball also "throws" us or pushes back on our hand with the same force.</p><p class="calibre2">Now we come to the force of gravity. Influenced by Johannes Kepler's work on planetary motion and Galileo Galilei's work on freely falling objects, Newton found out that there was a force that attracts two objects to each other. Two factors influence the degree of attraction. Mass and distance. The greater the mass of two objects or the closer the distance between them, the greater the attraction between them. This also means that the greater the distance between the objects, the weaker the force of gravity. <span>If </span>we for example double the distance, the force is as fourth as strong.</p><p class="calibre2">Mathematically we can state the force of attraction or gravitation as equal to the mass of one object multiplied with  the mass of the other object divided  by the  square  of  the  distance  between  the  objects.  All  this  is  multiplied  with  a constant (a number that doesn't change in value)-g (9.8 meters per second each second or 9.8m/s<span>2</span><span>  ).    </span>We can call g, the acceleration of gravity near the surface of the Earth.</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2">It is the force ofgravity that makes an apple fall toward the Earth.</p><p class="calibre2">The Earth attracts the apple with a force that is proportional to its mass and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. But Newton's third law says that the apple also exerts an equal and opposite force on the Earth. The force of attraction on the apple by the Earth is the same as the force of attraction on the Earth by the apple. So even if it looks to us like the apple falls to the Earth, both the Earth and apple fall toward each other. The force is the same but as we see from Newton's second law, not the acceleration. Their masses differ. The Earth's mass is so large compared to the apple that we see the apple "falling." Apples fall, starting at rest, to the Earth since they have less mass than the Earth, meaning they accelerate (change speed) more toward the Earth than the Earth does toward the apple. The Earth's great mass also explains why we fall toward the Earth when we slip.</p><p class="calibre2">The same force draws the Moon to the Earth. But what keeps the Moon in orbit around the Earth instead of crashing into the Earth?</p><p class="calibre2">Newton knew that there must be some force pulling the Moon toward the Earth. Otherwise according to the 1st law the Moon would continue in motion in a straight line at a steady speed instead of its more elliptical motion. Some force must continuously pull the Moon out of its straight-line motion and change its direction. And since the Moon's orbit is circular, this force must originate from the center of the Earth. Why? Newton knew that a centripetal force (any force</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2">195</p><p class="calibre2">directed toward a fixed center) controls objects going in a circle around a fixed point.</p><p class="calibre2">That force is gravity. <span>It </span>changes the Moons acceleration by continually changing its direction toward the center of the Earth causing the Moon to curve into circular motion. As the Moon moves horizontally in a direction tangent (the straight line that touches a curve) to the Earth, at each point along its path, gravity pulls it inward toward the center of the Earth and the result is a Moon in circular orbit.</p><p class="calibre2">The Moon's speed is great enough <span>to </span>ensure that its falling distance matches the Earth's curvature. The Moon remains at the same distance above Earth since the Earth curves at the same rate as the Moon "falls." By the time the Moon has fallen a certain distance toward Earth, it has moved sideways about the same distance. <span>If </span>its speed were much lower, the pull of gravity would gradually force the Moon</p><p class="calibre2">closer to the Earth until they crash into each other. <span>If </span>its speed where much higher,</p><p class="calibre2">the Moon would escape the force of gravity and move away from us.</p><p class="calibre2">The Moon doesn't accelerate as much as the apple, because of its distance to Earth (the force of gravity is weaker). The Moon in its orbit is about sixty times as far away from the Earth's center as the apple is.</p><p class="calibre2">Newton's law of gravitation isn't enough to describe the motion of objects whose speed is near the speed oflight. Why? According to Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, the mass of an object is not a constant. It increases as its speed approaches the speed oflight. Newton's theories and the theory of relativity also differ when gravitational fields are much larger than those found on Earth. Under most conditions, though, Newton's laws and his theory of gravitation are adequate.</p><p class="calibre2">The relative influence of gravity varies with size and scale.</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2">Why does falling.from a high tree not harm an insect?</p><p class="calibre2">In <span>Two New Sciences, </span>Galileo Galilei wrote: "Who does not know that a horse falling from a height of three or four cubits will break his bones, while a dog falling from the same height or a cat from a height of eight or ten cubits will suffer no injury?"</p><p class="calibre2">Imagine if a mouse, a horse and a human were to be thrown out of an airplane from 1,000 yards. What happens? The biologist <span>J</span>.B.S. Haldane said in <span>On Being the Right Size </span>(reprinted in The World of Mathematics): "You can drop a mouse</p><p class="calibre2">down a thousand-yard mine shaft; and, on arriving at the bottom, it gets a slight shock and walks away, provided that the ground is fairly soft. A rat is killed, a man is broken, a horse splashes."</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2">196</p><p class="calibre2">Physical forces act on animals differently. Gravity has a more powerful effect on bigger things, than on smaller things. Gravity is a major influence on us, but is of minor significance to smaller animals. Since human surface area is so small, gravitational forces act upon our weight. But gravity is negligible to very small animals with high surface area to volume ratios. The dominant force is then surface force. Haldane says: "Divide an animal's length, breadth, and height each by ten; its weight is reduced to a thousandth, but its surface only to a hundredth. So the resistance to falling in the case of the small animal is relatively ten times greater than the driving force [of gravity]."</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="calibre_rescale_" /></p><p class="calibre2">"Weight affects speed when air resistance is present.</p><p class="calibre2">On smaller scales, gravity becomes less and less important compared with air resistance. Throw a mouse off the plane and it floats down as frictional forces acting on its surface overcome the influence of gravity.</p><p class="calibre2">A falling object falls faster and faster, until the force of air drag acting in the opposite direction (arising from air resistance) equals its weight. Air drag depends on the surface area (the amount of air the falling object must plow through as it falls) and the speed of the falling object. Since a mouse has so much surface area compared to its small weight, it doesn't have to fall very fast before the upward acting air drag builds up to its downward-acting weight. The net force on the mouse is then zero and the mouse stops accelerating.</p><p class="calibre2">The force of air resistance against the falling horse is much greater than the force against the mouse. This happens because the horse plows through more air than the mouse does. The heavier horse falls faster through the air, increasing air resistance even more. The horse falls faster than the human before the air drag equals its weight and will therefore reach the ground first.</p><p class="calibre2">The horse has a greater surface area than the mouse, but the mouse has a greater surface area for its volume than the horse has. A mouse obeys the same law of gravitation as a human, and also the same law of air-resistance. But gravitation is key for humans, while air-resistance is all-important for the mouse. On the other hand, due to surface tension, the mouse will have problems when climbing from a pool of water. Haldane tells us a wet mouse has to carry its own weight of water. Imagine how hard it would be to get out of the bathtub if we</p><p class="calibre2">carried on our body a weight of water equal to our weight.</p><p class="calibre2">These examples show how we can better deal with reality by observing and ask "why" things happen.

    <p class="calibre2">Why have Warren Buffett and Charles Munger successfully compounded the book value of Berkshire Hathaway 3700 times over the last 42 years? Why do many people lose money investing?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">The reason we invest in an economic asset like a business, apartment building, farm, or bond is to make money. But what does that mean? What is making money? What happens when we make money?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Follow the cash. "How much cash do I get and when do I get it?"</p>
    <p class="calibre2">What happens when we make money is that we get more money back in the future than we invest today. For example, we invest $100 and get back $150.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">What determines our return from investing in an economic asset? The price we pay, how much money we get back, and when we get it back. It makes a huge difference if we get $150 back in 2 years or 10 years. The difference in yearly return is 22% versus 4%. Our return can be measured against the expected returns from other available investment opportunities. This means that the value of an economic asset is influenced by interest rates. <span>If </span>interest changes, value changes. The higher the rates, the less the value.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">If <span>we knew for certain we would get $10 in cash every year for 5 years and we use a risk-free government bond rate of 6% as the discount rate, then the asset has a value of about $42. This means that if we pay $42, we get a 6% average yearly rate of return. </span>If <span>we pay $30, our return rises to 20%. The larger the difference between an economic asset's value (e.g. $42) and the price we pay, the higher our yearly return becomes.</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2">Warren Buffett says, "We use the risk-free rate merely to equate one item to another. In other words, we're looking for whatever is <span>the </span>most attractive. In order to estimate the present value of anything, we're going <span>to </span>use a number. And, obviously, we can always buy government bonds. Therefore, that becomes the yardstick rate... to simply compare all <span>kinds </span>of investment opportunities across the spectrum: oil wells, farms, whatever it may be."</p>

    <p class="calibre2">The key question we should ask when investing money in economic assets is: What is the expected future cash we can take out and when does it appear? How else can we know what an asset may be worth and what kind of return we can expect at a given price? Warren Buffett says: "In the end, what you have to decide is whether you're going to value a business at $400 million, $600 million or $800 million - and then compare that with the price."</p>

    <p class="calibre2">Is this a good deal? It depends on the price John pays, and the discounted value of the cash that can be taken out of the ice cream store during its remaining life. How much cash can John take out? When can he take it out? This depends on the amount and timing of the free cash flow that is generated by the store or how much cash he can take out (and when) without hurting the store's present position against competition.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Warren Buffett says of the "cash flow" numbers that are often set forth in Wall Street reports:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">These numbers routinely include (a) [reported earnings] plus (b) [depreciation, depletion, amortization, and certain other non-cash charges] - but do not subtract (c) [the average annual amount of capitalized expenditures for plant and equipment, etc.] Most sales brochures of investment bankers also feature deceptive presentations of this kind. These imply that the business being offered is the commercial counterpart of the Pyramids - forever state-of-the-art, never needing to be replaced, improved or refurbished.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Some cash is always needed for reinvestment in capital expenditures for plant and equipment and working capital merely to enable a business to stay in business or maintain its unit volume and long-term competitive position. A classic example is a retail store that needs to install air-conditioning because other stores have made the investment. It doesn't generate any extra business, but without it, the store may lose customers to competition.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Buffett also says that we have <span>to </span>watch out for certain figures: "When companies or investment professionals use terms such as "EBITDA" and "pro forma," they want you <span>to </span>unthinkingly accept concepts that are dangerously flawed."</p>

    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Trumpeting EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is a particularly pernicious practice. Doing so implies that depreciation is not truly an expense, given that it is a "non-cash" charge. That's nonsense. In truth, depreciation is a particularly unattractive expense because the cash outlay it represents is paid up front, before the asset acquired has delivered any benefits to the business. Imagine, if you will, that at the beginning of this year a company paid all of its employees for the next ten years of their service (in the way they would lay out cash for a fixed asset <span>to </span>be useful for ten years). In the following nine years, compensation would be a "non-cash" expense - a reduction of a prepaid compensation asset established this year. Would anyone care to argue that the recording of the expense in years two through ten would be simply a bookkeeping formality?</p>

    </p>
    <p class="calibre2"><span>If </span>earnings not paid out in dividends are all successfully reinvested at compound interest for the benefit of the stockholder ... then these earnings should produce dividends later; if not, then they are money lost.... Earnings are only a means <span>to </span>an end, and the means should not be mistaken for the end. Therefore we must say that a stock derives its value from its dividends, not its earnings, In short, a stock is worth only <span>what you can get out of </span><span>it... </span>for we are discussing permanent investment, not speculative trading, and dividends for years to come, not income for the moment only.</p>

    <p class="calibre2">Is value a precise figure?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Warren Buffett says:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Intrinsic value is an estimate rather than a precise figure, and it is additionally an estimate that must be changed if interest rates move or forecasts of future cash flows are revised. Two people looking at the same set of facts, moreover - and this would apply even to Charlie and me - will almost inevitably come up with at least slightly different intrinsic value figures.</p>

    <p class="calibre2">203</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Using precise numbers is, in fact, foolish; working with a range of possibilities is the better approach.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Is there a difference between how we value different businesses?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">No matter whether a company makes telecom equipment, cars, or candy, it's still the same question: How much cash do we get and when? The name attached to the cash doesn't matter. Warren Buffett says:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">What you're trying to do is to look at all the cash a business will produce between now and judgment day and discount it back to the present using an appropriate discount rate and buy a lot cheaper than that. Whether the money comes from a bank, an Internet company, a brick company...the money all spends the same. Why pay more for a telecom business than a brick business? Money doesn't know where it comes from. There's no sense in paying more for a glamorous business if you're getting the same amount of money, but paying more for it. It's the same money that you can get from a brick company at a lower cost. The question is what are the economic characteristics of the bank, the Internet company or the brick company. That's going to tell you how much <span>cash </span>they generate over long periods in the future.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">What <span>if</span>John needs to invest more cash in the store?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">We have to consider the amount and timing of both cash into and from the store. <span>As </span>many investors in "growth" companies are well aware of, some businesses seem to need a never-ending supply of new cash. Warren Buffett says, "Growth can destroy value if it requires cash inputs in the early years of a project or enterprise that exceed the discounted value of the cash that those assets will generate in later years... Growth is simply a component- usually a plus, sometimes a minus - in the value equation."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">But isn't it easy going wrong in estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows in and out ofa business?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">At Berkshire, they deal with this problem in two ways. Warren Buffett says:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">First, we try to stick to businesses we believe we understand. That means they must be relatively simple and stable in character. <span>If </span>a business is complex or subject to constant change, we're not smart enough to predict future cash flows. Incidentally, that shortcoming doesn't bother us. What counts for most people in investing is not how much they know, but rather how realistically they define what they don't know. An investor needs to do very few things right as long as he or she avoids big mistakes.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Second, and equally important, we insist on a margin of safety in our purchase price. <span>If</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">204</p>
    <p class="calibre2">we calculate the value of a common stock to be only slightly higher than its price, we're not interested in buying. We believe this margin-of-safety principle, so strongly emphasized by Ben Graham, to be the cornerstone of investment success.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Warren Buffett also says that, "we try... to keep our estimates conservative." He continues:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">... take all of the variables and calculate 'em <span>reasonably </span>conservatively... don't focus too much on extreme conservatism on each variable in terms of the discount rate and the growth rate and so on; but try to be as realistic as you can on these numbers, with any errors being on the conservative side. And then when you get all through, you apply the margin of safety.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">It's the same thing Berkshire does in insurance. Buffett gives an example:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">If <span>we're trying to figure out what we should charge for, say, the chances of a 6.0 earthquake in California, we know that in the last century I think there've been 26 or so earthquakes in California that registered 6.0 or greater. And let's forget about whether they occur in remote areas. Let's just say we were writing a policy that paid off on a 6.0 or greater quake in California, regardless of whether it occurred in a desert and did no damage. Well, we would look at the history and we'd say, "Well, there've been 26 in the last century."</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2">And we would probably assume a little higher number in the next century. That'd just be our nature. However, we wouldn't assume 50 - because if we did, we wouldn't write any business. But we might assume a little higher. IfI were pricing it myself, I'd probably say, well, I'll assume that there are going to be 30 - or maybe 32 or something like that.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">And then when I'm all through, I'll want to put a premium on it that incorporates a margin of safety. In other words, if I were to figure that the proper rate for 32 was $1 million, I would probably want to charge something <span>more </span>than $1 million to build in that margin of safety. But I want to be conservative at all the levels - and then I want to have that <span>significant </span>margin of safety at the end.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">What can john reasonably expect the store to be worth?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">How much should John pay for the store? What future free cash flow can rationally be expected? How much cash can John take out and when?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Warren Buffett says, "You'd try to figure out what you were laying out currently and what you're likely to get back over time, how certain you felt about getting it and how it compared to other alternatives." He continues: "For our discount rate, we basically think in terms of the long-term government rate... But in times</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">205</p>
    <p class="calibre2">of what seem like very low rates, we might use a little higher rate." Buffett also says, "And that discount rate doesn't pay you as high a rate as it <span>needs </span>to."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">In 2003, Warren Buffett said, "We love owning common stocks - if they can be purchased at attractive prices... Unless, however, we see a very high probability of at least 10% pre-tax returns, we will sit on the sidelines."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Let's assume based on the store's history and expecting the same conditions in the future, John estimates that he can take out $300,000 in cash every year. Knowing he can always buy a risk-free government bond, John uses a bond rate of 6% as the discount rate. He also knows he can reinvest whatever cash he can take out from the store at 6%. The value of the store is then $5 million ($300,000/0.06).</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Whatever he can pay below this figure increases his expected return. But since cash from a business can't be as certain as cash from a government bond, why should John pay $5 million? Why should John take time and effort investing in something that gives him the same return as doing nothing? And since John can't know for certain whether expected cash flows will turn out as he expects, he should buy the store at a price that gives him a huge margin of safety.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">If <span>John's required rate of return is 10%, the value of the store is $3 million.</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2">Each person should use his own required rate of return. But whatever discount rate we use, we should always require a substantial discount from the estimated value in order to justify making the investment.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">We shouldn't engage in false precision. Warren Buffett says, "We believe that if you can pinpoint it, you're kidding yourself. Therefore, we think that when we make a decision there ought to be such a margin of safety - it ought to be so attractive - that you don't have to carry it out three decimal places." He continues: "We are very inexact ... How certain we are is the most important part... You'd be amazed at how inexact we are." Charles Munger says, "We never sit down, run the numbers out and discount them back to net present value... The decision should be obvious."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">We can use whatever discount rate we require and we can always compare investment opportunities with the long-term Treasury rate. But there is no point in calculating the value of the unpredictable. We need some certainty. Ask: How much confidence do I have in the numbers?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">We can't compensate what we can't predict with a higher discount rate. Warren Buffett says:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">When we look at the future of businesses, we look at riskiness as being sort of a go/no-go valve. In other words, if we think that we simply don't know what's going <span>to </span>happen in the</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">206</p>
    <p class="calibre2">future, that doesn't mean it's risky for everyone. It means <span>we </span>don't know - that it's risky for</p>
    <p class="calibre2">us. <span>It may not be risky for someone else who understands the business.</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2">However, in that case, we just give up. We don't try to predict those things. We don't say, "Well, we don't know what's going <span>to </span>happen. Therefore, we'll discount some cash flows that we don't even know at 9% instead of7%." That is not our way to approach it. Once it passes a threshold test of being something about which we feel quite certain, we tend <span>to </span>apply the same discount factor <span>to </span>everything. And we try to only buy businesses</p>
    <p class="calibre2">about which we're quite certain.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Should john always take out whatever cash he can?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">That depends on if the return for keeping the cash in the business is higher than the return John gets if he takes it out and invests somewhere else. Why should John want to take it out if he could reinvest the cash in the business at a higher return than 6%? And why should he not take the cash out if he can't reinvest it in the business at a higher return than 6%?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Here is a big difference between a company controlled by John and a public company where John only owns a part of the business. He doesn't control when to take the cash out in a public company. Both in private and public companies, cash may be reinvested at a mediocre return or into ideas that don't work. History has shown that many times reinvested cash has been wasted money and that a pay-out would have been better.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">How much cash flow the store will generate is mainly determined by three variables: <span>(1) </span>Sales - how many units of ice cream will be sold at what price? (2) Operating costs - how much does it cost to make the ice cream and conduct the business? (3) Invested capital - how much capital is needed to conduct the business? To what degree is this capital financed with debt rather than equity and at what cost?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">These variables determine what return the business earns on the capital that is invested in the store. Sales, costs, and capital need are largely determined by demand, competition from similar or substituting products, advantages against competition and their sustainability, cost and capital efficiency, and operational effectiveness in execution. What does this mean? Let's translate it into a simple question: Does the ice cream store have something people need or want now and in the future (demand), that no one else has (competitive advantage) or can copy or get now and in the future (sustainable) and can these advantages be translated into business value?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">For example, why do customers choose to buy ice cream from this store rather than from somewhere else? Is it location, assortment, taste, service,</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">207</p>
    <p class="calibre2">price? What do they associate the store and its products with? What is important to customers? Why do they come back? Have their motivations changed over the years or are they likely to change over the next 10 years? What incentives can cause customers to switch to or away from the store? What threats are there?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Warren Buffett illustrates his thinking:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2"><span>If </span>you and I were looking at the chewing gum business (and we own no Wrigley's, so I use it fairly often in class), you'd pick a figure that you would expect unit volumes of chewing gum <span>to </span>grow in the next 10-20 years and you'd give me your expectations about how much pricing flexibility Wrigley's has and how much danger there is that Wrigley's market share might be dramatically reduced-you'd go through all of that... We're evaluating the moat, the price elasticity that interacts with the moat in certain ways, the likelihood of unit demand changing in the future or management being either very bright with the cash that they develop or very stupid with it...</p>
    <p class="calibre2">I would say you can almost measure the strength of a business over time by the agony its managers go through in determining whether a price increase can be sustained ... You can learn a lot about the durability of the economics of a business by observing the price behavior.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Can competitors make the store's product obsolete or copy its advantages?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">If someone puts a store next to John's and customers don't see any difference between two stores products and services, then customers are likely to buy the ice cream in the store with the lowest prices.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Could John still make money having the lowest price? Yes, if demand exceeds supply or if John can produce and sell his ice cream at a lower cost than competition assuming of course competition doesn't want to run its business at a loss. John must run the store with extreme cost and capital efficiency relative to the competition. Lower costs and better use of capital allows him to keep the lowest price and still make money.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">How important is store management?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">How much cash and when John gets it is also a function of the ability and integrity of management. Management can influence owners' return by influencing the return of the business. It can influence where capital is being employed, and under what conditions money is to be reinvested.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">When it comes to integrity, Warren Buffett says it best:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">208</p>
    <p class="calibre2">One friend of mine said that in hiring they look for three things: intelligence, energy, and character. <span>If </span>they don't have the last one, the first two will kill you because, it's true, if you are going to hire somebody that doesn't have character, you had really better hope they are dumb and lazy, because, if they are smart and energetic, they'll get you in all kinds of trouble.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">A business may look to have a huge margin of safety in price but without an able and honest management this margin may end up as an illusion. History is filled with stories about great businesses that were destroyed by poor management. Ask: Is the company equipped with a competent and honest management that focuses on value? Will they use free cash flow for the benefit of the owners?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">But in some businesses, not even brilliant management helps. Warren Buffett shares his experiences:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">My conclusion from my own experiences and from much observation of other businesses is that a good managerial record (measured by economic returns) is far more a function of what business boat you get into than it is of how effectively you row (though intelligence and effort help considerable, of course, in any business, good or bad). Some years ago I wrote: "When a management with a repuration for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for poor fundamental economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact." Nothing has since changed my point of view on that matter. Should you find yourself in a chronically-leaking boat, energy devoted to changing vessels is likely <span>to </span>be more productive than energy devoted <span>to </span>patching leaks.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Let's take another example of "what happens". This time we describe a model from chemistry and give an example of a misused word - entropy.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">At 3.54 a.m. the city of Los Angeles woke up to a 6.5 earthquake.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Why does an earthquake crush so many structures and cause so many deaths? Why doesn't hot coffee stay hot? The answer to these questions gets to the heart of every spontaneous (means in chemistry "by itself, without energy input") physical or chemical event in our lives. The warmth in a hot beverage is due to fast moving molecules. They collide with slower moving molecules in the (relatively colder) environment and cause the slower ones to speed up. Energy is spread out from the hot liquid to the cup, the air, and by the currents of the air, to distant places. That is the nature of energy.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">The instant we drop a ball on the floor its energy becomes kinetic energy or energy due to movement. But the term isn't important. What happens is. All</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">209</p>
    <p class="calibre2">energy tends to spread, to become dispersed, if it is not hindered from doing so. That explains why iron rusts, why there are hurricanes, why objects break, etc. Why does a speeding truck running into a brick wall cause enormous destruction? Its kinetic energy not only tends to spread out; it spreads out catastrophically.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">The same with the earthquake. Stress in the earth caused by the slow movement of the earth's crust floating on its hot molten energy-filled core suddenly spreads. Its potential energy is instantly changed to kinetic energy as the earth moves. When such gigantic energy spreads, it shakes everything for miles around an epicenter. Because of that energy dispersal, not only buildings collapse, but lives are cut short.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Our lives are based on energy dispersal. Each second, chemicals in our body (converted within us from the food we eat and oxygen we breathe) keep our hearts beating. Our lungs pump oxygen into us and carbon dioxide out. We are energy processing machines. We must keep spreading out energy so that we are warm and keep making chemicals so our hearts beat and muscles work and our lungs function. If these processes are seriously interrupted - as they are in any major accident like an earthquake - we die.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2"><span>What does it mean (what happens) when we hear it was a magnitude 6.5 earthquake? </span>The Richter scale is a logarithmic scale developed by the geophysicist Charles <span>F. </span>Richter and measures the amplitude (size) of an earthquake from the recording of earthquake waves made on a seismograph. Each unit increase in the scale corresponds to a 10-fold increase in ground motion. A magnitude 7.5 earthquake produces 10 times more ground motion than a magnitude 6.5 earthquake. But since energy causes the damage, the important difference lies in the energy release. For every unit increase, energy release increases by a factor of about 32. A 7.5 earthquake releases about 32 times more energy than a 6.5.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Since 1900, the biggest earthquake in the U.S. occurred in Alaska in 1964. It had a magnitude of 9.2. What is the difference in strength or energy between a magnitude 9.2 earthquake and a 6.5 earthquake? About 11,220 times. This means that it would take 11,220 earthquakes of magnitude 6.5 to equal the energy released by a 9.2 earthquake. This explains the destructive power of big quakes.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">"Follow the energy. <span>"</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2">Entropy measures how much energy is spread out in a process, or how widely spread out it becomes - at a specific temperature. Entropy is a misused word,</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">210</p>
    <p class="calibre2">often used to explain all kinds of "disorder." Disorder is certainly characteristic of many of our situations in life - failed relationships, social problems, messy desks, disorderly bedrooms, etc. However, entropy has no relevance to these things. Only to the scientific measure of physical energy flow from being concentrated <span>to </span>being spread out.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">A room doesn't have a tendency <span>to </span>get messy by itself. Some outside energy is needed. It is the energy concentrated in our muscles that is being spread and causes our desks <span>to </span>be messed up. There is no energy being spread out in the papers themselves. As Chemistry Professor Frank Lambert says, "There isn't any 'tendency of objects <span>to </span>become disorganized' in nature any more than bank tellers have a 'tendency to give money to robbers' without a gun."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">That energy tends to spread explains why metal rusts, why things break and wear down. Since energy always flows from being concentrated <span>to </span>less concentrated; physical objects and chemical systems deteriorate, break or become destroyed. But these things don't happen immediately or spontaneously. The repetition of time and energy must be considered. A small push (or activation energy) is needed <span>to </span>start a reaction. Gasoline needs a spark or flame to react with oxygen. We need a match to light a fire. For example, it took a single spark <span>to </span>initiate the reaction between hydrogen gas and oxygen, causing the airship Hindenburg to burn. <span>It </span>takes movements of wind and warm moisture from a tropical ocean <span>to </span>form a hurricane. <span>It </span>takes oxygen and moisture <span>to </span>make iron rust. <span>It </span>takes energy <span>to </span>make wood rot. And this process can be delayed. This happens if we for example paint iron to prevent rusting. Painting keeps oxygen away from the iron so a reaction can't happen.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">These examples show how by observing "what happens" we can better understand reality.</p>

    <p class="calibre2">Charlie and I decided long ago that in an investment lifetime, it's just too hard to make hundreds of smart decisions. That judgment became ever more compelling as Berkshire's capital mushroomed and the universe of investments that could significantly affect our result shrank dramatically. Therefore, we adopted a strategy that required our being smart</p>
    <p class="calibre2">- and not too smart at that - only a very few times.</p>

    <p class="calibre2">William James said: "The art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook." Charles Munger tells us about the importance of eliminating nonsense: "Part of that [having uncommon sense], I think, is being able to tune out folly, as distinguished from recognizing wisdom. You've got whole categories of things you just bat away so your brain isn't cluttered with them. That way, you're better able to pick up a few sensible things to do."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Warren Buffett agrees:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Yeah, we don't consider many <span>stupid </span>things. I mean, we get rid of 'em fast... Just getting rid of the <span>nonsense </span><span>- </span>just figuring out that if people call you and say, ''I've got this great, wonderful idea'', you don't spend 10 minutes once you know in the first sentence that it isn't a great, wonderful idea...

    <p class="calibre2">Often we try to get too much information, including misinformation, or information of no use to explain or predict. We also focus on details and what's irrelevant or unknowable and overlook the obvious truths. Dealing with what's important forces us to prioritize. There are often just a few actions that produce most of what we are trying to achieve. There are only a few decisions of real importance.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">More information doesn't equal more knowledge or better decisions. And remember that today we not only have access to more information, but also misinformation. Charles Munger says: "The harder you work, the more confidence you get. But you may be working hard on something that is false."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">In Arthur Conan Doyle's <span>The Reigate Puzzle, </span>Sherlock Holmes says: <span>"It </span>is of the highest importance in the art of detection to be able to recognize, out of a number of facts, which are incidental and which vital."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Turn off the noise or what's irrelevant and look at the big picture. Ask: Why am I doing this? What really matters? What is important for what I want to achieve? Will more information affect my decision? Don't collect data randomly. Start with why the particular information is needed in the first place.</p>

      <a id="calibre_link-245">I'm a follower of what I call the Thomas Hunt Morgan school. Morgan was one of the great biologists in the history of the world who figured out a lot of genetics [Morgan established that chromosomes carried the units of inheritance] with very slender resources in a so-called "fly room" - first at Columbia and then at Caltech. And when Morgan reached Caltech, he did something that was very peculiar. He banned the Friden calculator</a>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">- which was the computer of that age - from the biology department. Everybody else at Caltech used the Friden calculator endlessly for all kinds of statistical correlations and much else. Morgan <span>banned </span>it.</p>

    <p class="calibre2">Well, that's the way I go at life. I think if you get the big points with organized common sense, it's amazing the placer mining you never have to do ...</p>
    <p class="calibre2">But is there still enormous gain to be made with organized common sense that doesn't require a computer? I think the answer is "yes." Are there dangers in getting too caught up in the minutiae of using a computer so that you miss the organized common sense? There are <span>huge </span>dangers.

    <p class="calibre2">Deal with the situations in life by knowing what to avoid. Reducing mistakes by learning what areas, situations and people to avoid is often a better use of time than seeking out new ways of succeeding. Also, it is often simpler <span>to </span>prevent something than to solve it. 13th Century jurist and priest Henry de Bracton said: "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."</p>

    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Easy does it. After 25 years of buying and supervising a great variety of businesses, Charlie and I have not learned how to solve difficult business problems.

      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />

    <p class="calibre2">We basically have the attitude that you can't make a good deal with a bad person. We don't try <span>to </span>protect ourselves by contracts or all kinds of due diligence - we just forget about it. We can do fine over time dealing with people we like and admire and trust.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">And the bad actor will try <span>to </span>tantalize you in one way or another. But you won't win. <span>It </span>pays <span>to </span>just avoid him.

    <p class="calibre2">I've heard Warren say since very early in his life that the difference between agood business and a bad one is that a good business throws up one easy decision after another, whereas a bad one gives you <span>horrible </span>choices - decisions that are extremely hard <span>to </span>make: "Can it work?" "Is it worth the money?"</p>
    <p class="calibre2">One way to determine which is the good business and which is the bad one is to see which one is throwing management bloopers - pleasant, no-brainer decisions - time after time after time.</p>

    <p class="calibre2">Focus on what you can know and that makes a difference</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Before attacking a problem ask if it is worth solving or spending time on. Warren Buffett explains one of the reasons for his and Charles Munger's success in life and business:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">There are two questions you ask yourself as you look at the decision you'll make. A) is it knowable? B) is it important? Ifit is not knowable, as you know there are all kinds of things that are important but not knowable, we forget about those. And if it's unimportant, whether it's knowable or not, it won't make any difference. We don't care.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">What's knowable and important? And what can be translated into useful action? Some important things we can't know. Like where the stock market is going. Other things we can know but they are not important.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Ask the right questions</p>
    <p class="calibre2">The formulation ofa problem is often more essential than its solution, which may be merely a matter of mathematical or experimental skill.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">- Albert Einstein</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Sometimes it is harder to understand a problem than to solve it. Asking the important questions may help. Start with basic questions like: What does it mean? What is the simplest example? What is the number one question? How can I tell if the answer is right? Can I come up with an example that makes it clear what the problem is?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">But it is not enough to ask the right questions. We must look at the right place and ask the right person. We can't rely too much on assumptions since we can't be sure that someone else's assumptions are the same as ours, unless we ask them to explain.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">In nearly every detective novel since the admirable stories of Conan Doyle there comes a time where the investigator has collected all the facts he needs for at least some phase of his problem. These facts often seem quite strange, incoherent, and wholly unrelated.

So he plays his violin, or lounges in his armchair enjoying a pipe, when suddenly, by Jove, he has it!</p>

Have patience in waiting for opportunities. Resist the temptation <span>to </span>always do something. <span>If </span>we are in a hurry, it's easier <span>to </span>make misjudgments. This is key in investing. Warren Buffett says, "In allocating capital, activity does not correlate with achievement. Indeed, in the fields of investments and acquisitions, frenetic behavior is often counterproductive." He continues: <span>"If </span>you feel like you have <span>to </span>invest every day, you're going to make a lot of mistakes. It isn't that kind of a</p>

    <p class="calibre2">What can help us avoid problems and act as guidelines when making decisions? Based on our knowledge of reality and our personal situation we should establish some "what <span>to </span>do" and "what <span>to </span>avoid" rules.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Charles Munger gives an example of a rule:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Any time anybody offers you <i class="calibre4">anything </i>with a big commission and a 200-page prospectus, don't buy it.

    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Another rule comes from Benjamin Franklin: "To apply myself industriously <span>to </span>whatever business I take at hand, and not divert my mind from my business by any foolish project of growing suddenly rich; for industry and patience are the surest means of plenty."</p>

    <p class="calibre2">What counts in this business is underwriting discipline. The winners are those that unfailingly stick to three key principles:</p>
    <ol id="calibre_link-252" class="calibre11">
      <li class="calibre6">
        <p class="calibre2">They accept only those risks that they are able to properly evaluate (staying within their circle of competence) and that, after they have evaluated all relevant factors including remote loss scenarios, carry the expectancy ofprofit. These insurers ignore market-share considerations andare sanguine about losing business to competitors that are offering foolish prices or policy conditions.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="calibre6">
        <p class="calibre2">They limit the business they accept in a manner that guarantees they will suffer no aggregation of losses.from a single event or.from related events that will threaten their solvency. They ceaselessly search for possible correlation among seemingly-unrelated risks.</p>

    </ol>
    <p class="calibre2">218</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <a id="calibre_link-253">3. They avoid business involving moral risk: No matter what the rate, trying to write good contracts with bad people doesn't work. While most policyholders and clients are honorable and ethical, doing business with the few exceptions is usually expensive, sometimes extraordinarily so.</a>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">I have known the details of almost every policy that Ajit [Ajit Jain] has written... and never on even a single occasion have I seen him break any of our three underwriting rules. His extraordinary discipline, of course, does not eliminate losses; it does, however, prevent foolish losses. And that's the key: Just as in the case of investing, insurers produce outstanding long term results primarily by avoiding dumb decisions, rather than by making brilliant ones.</p>

    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Filters help us prioritize and figure out what makes sense.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">When we know what we want, we need criteria <span>to </span>evaluate alternatives. Ask: What are the most critical (and knowable) factors that will cause what I want to achieve or avoid? Criteria must be based on evidence and be reasonably predictive, i.e., we must do better than chance by relying on them. Try to use as few criteria as necessary <span>to </span>make your judgment. Then rank them in order of their importance and use them as filters. Set decision thresholds in a way that minimizes the likelihood of false alarms and misses (in investing, choosing a bad investment or missing a good investment). Consider the consequences of being wrong. For example, in medicine, a threshold depends on factors such as the prevalence of a condition, its seriousness, the availability of corrective measures, and the emotional and financial costs of false alarms.</p>

    <p class="calibre2">Past criminal and prison records are more reliable than expert criminologists in predicting success on parole.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Studies show that in some fields, when based on the same evidence, a more mechanical prediction process involving a small number of relevant variables is more reliable than the predictions of trained and experienced experts. This has been shown in diagnoses of medical conditions, predictions of academic performance, in determining gambling odds, and loan and credit risk. Why does it work better? Because we humans are not always consistent. As we have seen, recent experiences, suggestions, or how information is presented may influence us.

Late Statistics Professor Leo Breiman and colleagues at University of California, Berkeley, developed a method <span>to </span>classify high-risk heart attack patients using only a maximum of 3 variables. Blood pressure, age and sinus tachycardia (rapid heartbeat).</p>
    <p class="calibre2">If <span>a patient's minimum systolic blood pressure over the initial 24-hour period is less than 91, he is immediately classified as high risk. </span>If <span>not, the second variable is age. </span>If <span>the patient is over 62.5 years old, then one more variable - sinus tachycardia</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2">Elimination</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Elimination is a great conservator of effort. For example, place the burden of proof on statements that contradict basic scientific ideas. Eliminate situations that may cause great sorrow, what is not important or knowable, what can't happen or be achieved, what can't usefully be predicted or explained, what can't be tested, what is already disproved, the easy decisions, the wrong assumptions, what we can't do something about or problems where we don't have any competence.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Science works by elimination. To avoid drowning in low-information observations or experiments, scientists think in advance about what the most important and conclusive experiments would be: What are we trying to achieve or prove, and how can we reach these ends? What can't happen? This way, they narrow down the possibilities. <span>It </span>is similar to what Warren Buffett told us in Part One - eliminate possibilities and get down to the few that have any chance of success. Look for certain things that narrow down the possibilities.</p>

    <p class="calibre2">In power systems we need surplus of capacity. And how do we get that? By giving people an incentive for having extra capacity. A power business can't be punished for not having excess capacity and can't be rewarded for having less then what is needed.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">We need three things for this not <span>to </span>happen again. One is that we need reasonable efficiency in operations. Secondly, since it does tend <span>to </span>have in many situations monopoly characteristics, we want something that produced a fair return, but not a great return, on capital - enough to attract new capital.

    <p class="calibre2">When we solve problems and know what we want to achieve, we need to prioritize or focus on the right problems. What should we do first? Ask: How serious are the problems?

    <p class="calibre2">Marcus Tullius Cicero said: "Extreme justice is extreme injustice." Some systems should be made deliberately a little unfair if they carry better consequences for us <span>all. </span>Charles Munger tells us about the Navy model - a rule with net benefits:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2"><span>If </span>you're a captain in the Navy and you've been up for 24 hours straight and have to go to sleep and you turn the ship over to a competent first mate in tough conditions and he takes the ship aground - clearly through no fault of <span>yours </span><span>- </span>they don't court martial you, but your naval career is <span>over.</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2">Napoleon said he liked luckier generals - he wasn't into supporting losers. Well, the Navy likes luckier captains.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">You can say, "That's too <span>tough. </span>That's not law school. That's not due process." Well, the Navy model is <span>better </span>in its context than would be the law school model. The Navy model <span>really </span>forces people to pay attention when conditions are tough - because they know that there's no <span>excuse. </span>Very simply, if your ship goes aground, your career is over.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">"It doesn't <span>matter </span>whether it was your fault or not. Nobody's <span>interested </span>in your fault. It's just a <span>rule </span>that we happen to have - for the good of all, all effects considered."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">I <span>like </span>some rules like that - I think that the civilization works <span>better </span>with some of these no-fault rules. But that stuff tends to be anathema around law schools. "It's not due process. You're not really searching for justice."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Well, I <span>am </span>searching for justice when I argue for the Navy rule - for the justice of fewer ships going aground. Considering the net benefit, I don't <span>care </span>if one captain has some unfairness in his life. After all, it's not like he's being court marshalled. He just has to look for a new line of work. And he keeps vested pension rights and so on. So it's not like it's the end of the world.</p>

    <p class="calibre2">Warren Buffett describes what businesses are best to own:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Leaving the question of price aside, the best business to own is one that over an extended period can employ large amounts of incremental capital at very high rates of return. The worst business to own is one that must, or <span>will, </span>do the opposite - that is, consistently employ ever-greater amounts of capital at very low rates of return.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Should higher earnings automatically impress us?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Warren Buffett gives an example from one of Berkshire's subsidiaries:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">While an increase in earnings from $8 million to $72 million sounds terrific - and usually is -you should not automatically assume that to be the case. You must first make sure that earnings were not depressed in the base year. <span>If </span>they were instead substantial in relation to capital employed, an even more important point must be examined: how much additional capital was required to produce the additional earnings?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">We need <span>to </span>understand what is behind the numbers. Warren Buffett says that, "return on beginning equity capital" is "the most appropriate measure of single year managerial performance. Informed use of that yardstick, however, requires, an understanding of many factors, including accounting policies, historical carrying values of assets, financial leverage, and industry conditions."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">We can't expect <span>to </span>get a higher return on investment over time than the</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />

    <p class="calibre2">232</p>
    <p class="calibre2">underlying business produces on its invested capital over time. Charles Munger says:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Over the long term, it's hard for a stock <span>to </span>earn a much better return than the business which underlies it earns. <span>If </span>the business earns 6% on capital over 40 years and you hold it for that 40 years, you're not going <span>to </span>make much different than a 6% return - even if you originally buy it at a huge discount. Conversely, if a business earns 18% on capital over 20 or 30 years, even if you pay an expensive looking price, you'll end up with a fine result.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Few companies can manage, over a ten <span>to </span>twenty-year period, to keep earning high returns on 20% or more on invested capital while reinvesting all or most of their earnings. Changes in the competitive arena, buyer habits, and the environment will make that almost a certainty.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Warren Buffett reveals the limits of earnings growth and how lofty predictions lead to dumb behavior:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Examine the record of, say, the 200 highest earning companies from 1970 or 1980 and tabulate how many have increased per-share earnings by 15% annually since those dates. You will find that only a handful have. I would wager you avery significant sum that fewer than 10 of the 200 most profitable companies in 2000 will attain 15% annual growth in earnings-per-share over the next 20 years.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">He continues:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Finally, be suspICtous of companies that trumpet earnings projections and growth expectations. Businesses seldom operate in a tranquil, no-surprise environment, and earnings simply don't advance smoothly (except, of course, in the offering books of investment bankers).</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Charlie and I not only don't know today what our businesses will earn <i class="calibre4">next year </i>- we don't even know what they will earn <i class="calibre4">next quarter. </i>We are suspicious of those CEOs who regularly claim they do know the future - and we become downright incredulous if they consistently reach their declared targets. Managers that always promise to "make the numbers" will at some point be tempted <span>to </span><i class="calibre4">make up </i>the numbers.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Suddenly demand goes down and price competition rises.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">How does a change in growth rate change business value? Business value is a function of the amount and timing of future cash flows. <span>If </span>cash flows decreases and/or appears further off in the future, business value declines.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">233</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Warren Buffett illustrates how valuations must change when growth expectations are revised:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">A few years ago the conventional wisdom held that a newspaper, television or magazine property would forever increase its earnings at 6% or so annually and would do so <span>without the employment of additional capital </span>for the reason that depreciation charges would roughly match capital expenditures and working capital requirements would be minor. Therefore, reported earnings (before amortization of intangibles) were also freely distributable earnings, which meant that ownership of a media property could be construed as akin to owning a perpetual annuity set to grow at 6% a year. Say, next, that a discount rate of 10% was used to determine the present value of that earnings stream. One could then calculate that it was appropriate to pay a whopping $25 million for a property with current after-tax earnings of $1 million (1/0.1-0.06).</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Now change the assumption and posit that the $1 million represents "normal earning power" and that earnings will bob around this figure cyclically. A "bob-around" pattern is indeed the lot of most businesses, whose income stream grows only if their owners are willing <span>to </span>commit more capital (usually in the form of retained earnings). Under our revised assumption, $1 million of earnings, discounted by the same 10%, translates to a</p>
    <p class="calibre2">$10 million valuation. Thus a seemingly modest shift in assumptions reduce the property's valuation to 10 times after-tax earnings.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Do we pay the same price for a business financed with debt as for a business with no debt?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Assume Mary is interested in buying a furniture store. The business is stable with no growth, free cash flow of 15 and financed with 75 in equity. A price of 100 (15/0.15) will give her a 15% return. Does debt make a difference? Yes, the seller could then make extra money by leveraging the business before selling it.<span>If </span>the seller refinances the business with 50 in debt (and the business can borrow at 6% interest) and withdraws 50 as a dividend, income after interest would be 12 (15-3). <span>If </span>Mary then buys the store for 80 (12/0.15) the seller would have made an extra 30 (50+80-</p>
    <p class="calibre2">100) without any change in the underlying operations of the business.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Instead Mary should assume she acquires a debt-free business and adjust for 50 of debt and pay 50 (15/0.15-50). She should also correct (add <span>to </span>the price) for excess cash - cash or cash assets that aren't needed <span>to </span>conduct the business.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">This is the same type of reasoning as when we buy a house. <span>If </span>we for example</p>
    <p class="calibre2">buy a house for $500,000 and put in $200,000 of our own saved money and mortgage the rest or $300,000, the price of the house is still $500,000.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">234</p>
    <p class="calibre2">"The synergies we expected from the merger never materialized They were mere illusions. <span>"</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2">Don't forget to quantify consequences when making acquisitions. Take the profit &amp; loss statement and balance sheet of the acquiring company and the target company. Calculate what happens with volume, prices, cost, and invested capital when the companies combine, considering consequences and behavioral changes of employees, suppliers, customers, and competition. How does business value change? Be realistic. Studies show that most mergers fail to generate value for the acquiring company's owners. The main reason is that the buyer paid too much for synergies that weren't real.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">"Of one thing, however, be certain," says Warren Buffett, <span>"If </span>a CEO is enthused about a particularly foolish acquisition, both his internal staff and his outside advisors will come up with whatever projections are needed to justify his stance. Only in fairy tales are emperors told they are naked."</p>

    <p class="calibre2">We can do a simple exercise <span>to </span>test our possible return from investing in a company and if its market valuation makes sense. Just think about the math implicit.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Below are some examples where we have ignored dividends and options (in reality we need <span>to </span>properly account for options and make sure that the company's accounting reflects reality and the true operational performance.) Think of a stock as part of a business and remember that small changes in assumptions can dramatically change value.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">John is thinking of buying 1,000 shares of stock in a public ice cream manufacturer with a market value of $1 billion and no debt or off-balance sheet obligations. How should John reason?</p>

    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">What is my estimated annual rate of return?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">John projects the future value, and then compares that value with the present market value of $1 billion. What is his implied annual rate of return? Will the price paid give him an adequate return?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">The business has initial cash earnings (earnings+ amortization of goodwill) of</p>
    <p class="calibre2">$40 million and an assumed average annual growth rate in cash earnings of 10% for 10 years. This translates into $104 million in cash earnings in year 10. Assume the market pays an average multiple of 15 for this type of business. This implies</p>
    <p class="calibre2">$1.56 billion in market value in year 10. <span>If </span>John compares this figure with the present market value, his implied yearly return is 4.5%. John compares this return with the return from other available investment opportunities. A business may have a great track record, but if the math doesn't work, stay away.</p>

    <p class="calibre2">What scenario achieves a 15% annual rate of return?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">How much must the ice cream manufacturer earn to generate a 15% annual rate of return for John? <span>If </span>the present market value compounds at 15%, what does this imply and is it reasonable?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">A present market value of $1 billion and an annual return of 15% imply $4 billion in market value in year 10. This is what $1 billion will grow to in 10 years if it grows 15% per year. An average multiple of 15 implies $270 million in cash earnings in year 10. This translates into an average annual growth rate in cash earnings of 21% (from a base of $40 million). A profit margin of 15% implies</p>

    <p class="calibre2">John then asks: What causes this future value? What does this imply in numbers today? Is it reasonable regarding evidence of track record in growth, earnings, profit margins, market size/volume growth, market share, competitive advantage, etc? Which factor has the greatest impact on future cash earnings and thereby value? What forces can change this scenario? How can the company lose its advantages?</p>

    <p class="calibre2">When we buy a stock, we always think in terms of buying the whole enterprise because it enables us to think as businessmen rather than stock speculators. So let's just take a company that has marvelous prospects, that paying you nothing now where you buy it at a valuation of$500 billion... For example, let's assume that there's only going to be a one year delay before the business starts paying out to you and you want to get a 10% return. <span>If </span>you paid $500 billion, then $55 billion in cash is the amount that it's going to have to</p>
    <p class="calibre2">be able to disgorge to you year after year after year. To do that, it has to make perhaps $80 billion, or close to it, pretax. Look around at the universe of businesses in this world and see how many are earning $80 billion pretax - or $70 billion or $60 or $50 or $40 or even</p>

    <p class="calibre2">In 1986, the space shuttle Challenger exploded on launch, killing all astronauts aboard. After the disaster, NASA put together a commission where Richard Feynman showed that the fuel booster rockets were not safe when the temperature was cold. The temperature at takeoff was 32 <span>F. </span>During a launch, vibrations cause the rocket joints to move. Inside the rocket joints there were rubber O-rings that are used in a certain key stage in the space shuttle's fuel delivery system.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Richard Feynman did a simple experiment with a rubber O-ring from the Challenger rocket. He squeezed the rings in a C-clamp and dipped them in a glass of ice water (32 F) and showed that the rubber didn't expand. Since there was no resilience in the rubber at 32 F, the O-ring could not fill the gap in the expanding rocket booster joints. It consequently caused an explosion of the booster and the space shuttle.</p>

Owing to this habit, very few objections were raised against my views which I had not at least noticed and attempted to answer ...</p>
    <p class="calibre2">I think that I have become a little more skillful in guessing right explanations and in devising experimental tests; but this may probably be the result of mere practice, and of a larger store of knowledge. I have as much difficulty as ever in expressing myself clearly and concisely; and this difficulty has caused me a very great loss of time; but it has had the compensating advantage of forcing me to think long and intently about every sentence, and thus I have been led to see errors in reasoning and in my own observations or those of others.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">Instead of asking how we can achieve a goal, we ask the opposite question: What don't I want to achieve (non-goal)? What causes the non-goal? How can I avoid that? What do I now want to achieve? How can I do that? For example, instead of searching for how John and Mary can improve their marriage, they ask: "What qualities will destroy our marriage?" One quality is dishonesty. Now they</p>
        <p class="calibre2">244</p>
        <p class="calibre2">reinvert the question back and ask: "How can we improve our marriage?" Be honest. (See also Charles Munger's brilliant speech on prescriptions for guaranteed misery in Appendix One).</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Charles Munger provides an enlightening example on how dumb systems cause dumb behavior:</p>

        <p class="calibre2">Let's say you have a desire to do public service. <span>As </span>a natural part of your planning, you think in reverse and ask, "What can I do to <span>ruin </span>our civilization?" That's easy. <span>If </span>what you want to do is to ruin your civilization, just go to the legislature and pass laws that create systems wherein people can easily cheat. <span>It </span>will work perfectly. Take the workers' compensation system in California. Stress is <span>real </span>And its misery can be real. So you want</p>
        <p class="calibre2">to compensate people for their stress in the workplace. It seems like a noble thing to do. But the trouble with such a compensation practice is that it's practically impossible <span>to </span>delete huge cheating. And once you reward cheating, you get crooked <span>lawyers, </span>crooked <span>doctors, </span>crooked <span>unions, </span>etc. participating in referral schemes. You get a total <span>miasma </span>of disastrous behavior. And the behavior makes all the people doing it <span>worse </span>as they do it. So you were trying to help your civilization. But what you did was create enormous <span>damage, </span>net. So it's much better to let some things go uncompensated - to let life be hard - than</p>

Because in order to know what not to think about, your brain must first think about it. When John is on a golf course trying to hit over a water hazard in front of the green, he doesn't say to himself, "I don't want to hit the ball in the water," but instead "I want to hit the ball on the green."

Why do certain businesses lose money or fail? Why do smart people engage in foolish behavior? Why do certain accidents happen? What was the mistake that caused bad performance? What circumstances were present? What's the lesson?</p>
        <p class="calibre2">When we know this, we should ask: What people or businesses are doing things that history has proven causes failure? How can we best avoid what we don't want to happen? How can we create the best conditions to avoid mistakes? How can we prevent causes that can't be eliminated? How can we limit the consequences of what we want to avoid? How can we limit the probability of what we want to avoid?</p>

    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">The simple fact is that you can't tell whether an idea is likely to work unless you consider all the possible negatives... Okay, it's a good company. But is the price low enough? Is the management made up of people Munger and Buffett are comfortable with? If it is cheap enough to buy, is it cheap for the wrong reason or the right reason? As Munger puts it: "What's the flip side, what can go wrong that I haven't seen?"</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Being wrong causes both an actual loss and an opportunity cost. When investing, we can either lose our capital - we invest 10 and get back 5 - or we get an inadequate return - for example 3% versus 6% from a bond. What does Warren Buffett say about business risk?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">When we look at businesses, we try to look at businesses that are good businesses today and think about what can go wrong. We think of business risk in terms of what can happen five, 10 or 15 years from now that will destroy, modify or reduce the economic strengths we believe currently exist in the business. And for some businesses, that's impossible to figure - at least it's impossible for us to figure - and we don't even think about it. If we can think of very much that can go wrong, we just forget it.</p>

    <p class="calibre2">In stocks, we expect every commitment to work out well because we concentrate on conservatively financed businesses with strong competitive strengths, run by able and honest people. <span>If </span>we buy into these companies at sensible prices, losses should be rare.

    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">I had a relative by marriage who died in his late 80s. And I don't think he ever had a loss. He only did about eight things in his lifetime. He started with a small poke, and if something wasn't a near cinch, he didn't do it. He lived well and died rich. I think it's possible for a great many people to live a life like that where there isn't much risk of disaster and where they're virtually sure to get ahead a reasonable amount. It takes a lot of judgment, a lot of discipline and an absence of hyperactivity. By this method, I think most intelligent people can take a lot of risk out oflife.</p>

    <p class="calibre2">Over time, markets will do extraordinarily, even bizarre things. A single, big mistake</p>

    <p class="calibre2">see there's any other choice."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">We all have 24 hours in the day. We can't save time, only spend it wisely or foolishly. How do we use our time? What is the best use? What do we want out of life? Do we live in a way to make that possible? The shorter the list, the more likely it is to focus on things that matter. Know what we want and don't want. Do we do what we want to do or what others expect us to do? Who or what is most important in our life? Do we have a sense of meaning?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Part of avoiding misjudgments and improving our lives is having the right attitude toward life. Since people are different, there is no one-size-fits-all strategy. We each must figure out our own style. But there are guidelines that apply to us all.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">We should act in a way that agrees with our nature, advantages and limitations and we should establish (and follow) some values.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">How can we expect to succeed in a field we don't understand? We reduce the likelihood of making mistakes if we deal with things that agree with our nature, and things we understand and do well. We have a better chance solving problems and evaluating statements if they are within our area of competence. Confucius said: "To know that we know what we know, and that we do not know, what we do not know; that is true knowledge." We must determine our abilities and limitations. We need to know what we don't know or are not capable of knowing and avoid those areas. As Warren Buffett says:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">You have to stick within what I call your circle of competence. You have <span>to </span>know what you understand and what you don't understand. It's <span>not </span>terribly important how <span>big </span>the circle is. But it's <span>terribly </span>important that you know <span>where </span>the perimeter is.</p>

    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">We'd rather deal with what we understand. Why should we want to play a competitive game in a field where we have <span>no </span>advantage - maybe a <span>disadvantage </span><span>- </span>instead of playing in a field where we have a clear <span>advantage?</span></p>

But if you try to succeed in what you're worst at, you're going <span>to </span>have a very louse career. I can almost guarantee it. To do otherwise, you'd have <span>to </span>buy a winning lottery ticket or get very lucky somewhere else.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Ask: What is my nature? What motivates me? What is my tolerance for pain and risk? What has given me happiness and unhappiness in the past? What things and people am I comfortable with? What are my talents and skills? Do I know the difference between what I want and what I'm good at? Where do I have an edge over others? What are my limitations?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">How can we do what is important if we don't have any values? If we don't stand for something, we fall for anything.</p>

    <p class="calibre2">

    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Act honorably. Listen to the words of Mark Twain: "Always do right. This will gratify some people and astonish the rest."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Tell the truth. Follow Lou Vincenti's rule (former Chairman ofWesco): <span>"If </span>you tell the truth you don't have to remember your lies."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Honesty pays. Charles Munger says: "More often we've made extra money out of morality. Ben Franklin was right for us. He didn't say honesty was the best morals, he said that it was the best policy."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Act with integrity and individuality. Heraclitus said: "The content of your character is your choice. Day by day, what you choose, what you think, and what you do is who you become. Your integrity is your destiny.. .it is the light that guides your way."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Every human being is unique so we have the right to be different. Why is integrity the real freedom? Because if we have nothing to hide we have nothing to fear.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Charles Munger says:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">We think there should be a huge area between ... what you are <span>willing </span><span>to </span>do and what you can do without a significant risk of suffering criminal penalty or causing losses. We believe you shouldn't go anywhere <span>near </span>that line. You ought to have an internal compass. So there should be all kinds of things you won't do even though they're perfectly legal. That's the way we try <span>to </span>operate.</p>

    <p class="calibre2">Observe what signals you send out. Charles Munger tells us that some people have a duty <span>to </span>create the right appearance: <span>''A </span>person who rises high in the Army or becomes a Supreme Court justice is expected to be an exemplar, so why shouldn't someone who rises high in a big corporation act as an exemplar?"</p>

    <p class="calibre2">You don't want your first grade teacher to be fornicating on the floor or drinking booze in the classroom.

    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">One of the things that's been horribly underdone is the concept where the military equivalent is conduct unbecoming an officer. When you rise to a certain point in a civilization, you ought to have a duty to behave as an exemplar. When is the last time you heard in a boardroom, 'Is this consistent with our duties as exemplars?' I mean the very <span>word </span>has an antique ring to it 'exemplar'. But that's exactly what is horribly lacking.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">And everybody can see that that's what's required. The military concept of conduct unbecoming an officer is an important one. Your duty is to not cause resentment and envy and a lot of other things. You have a big duty as an exemplar."</p>

    <p class="calibre2">How can we teach ethics? Charles Munger says:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">I think the best single way to teach ethics is by example. And that means if you take in people who demonstrate in all their daily conduct an appropriate ethical framework, I think that has</p>
    <p class="calibre2">255</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <a id="calibre_link-290">enormous influence on the people who watch it. Conversely, if your ethics slip, and if people are being rewarded for ethical slips, then I think your ethics cascade downward at a very, very rapid rate.</a>
      <a id="calibre_link-291">â</a>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">I think ethics are terribly important, but I think they're best taught indirectly by example. <span>If</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2">you just sort oflearn a few rules and remember 'em well enough <span>to </span>pass a test, my guess is it doesn't do all that much for people's ethics. But if you see people you admire behaving a certain way- particularly under stress - I think you're likely <span>to </span>remember and be affected by that for a long, long time.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Treat people fairly</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Warren Buffett says that: "The only way to be loved is <span>to </span>be lovable. You always get back more than you give away. <span>If </span>you don't give any you won't get any." Lao Tsu said: "Respond intelligently even to unintelligent treatment." Be nice to people and if they are not nice <span>to </span>you - don't be nasty - just avoid them in the future. Follow the advice of Charles Darwin - avoid controversies:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">I rejoice that I have avoided controversies, and this I owe to Lyell, who many years ago, in reference to my geological works, strongly advised me never to get entangled in a controversy, as it rarely did any good and caused a miserable loss of time and temper. ..</p>
    <p class="calibre2">All that I think is that you [letter <span>to </span>E. Haeckel) will excite anger, and that anger so completely blinds every one that your arguments would have no chance of influencing those who are already opposed to our views.</p>

    <p class="calibre2">

    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Have perspective. Remember Samuel Johnson's words: "Distance has the same effect on the mind as on the eye." When we <span>fail </span>we should view it as a learning expenence.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Have a positive attitude. Mayo Clinic researchers report that optimists report a higher level of physical and mental functioning than pessimists. Studies at the Mayo Clinic also show that optimists live longer than pessimists. Having a positive attitude also causes the body to produce pain-suppressing hormones, called endorphins, which work like morphine.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Warren Buffett says on the value of enthusiasm:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">256</p>
    <p class="calibre2"><a id="calibre_link-292">I do think enthusiasm is a good quality </a><span>to </span>have generally. It has helped me... I like managers in our businesses that are enthusiastic. These people are enthusiastic about their work in the same way people can get enthusiastic about golf, and that translates into results. <span>If </span>you are in a job that you are not enthusiastic about, find something else. You're not doing yourself any favor, and you're not doing your employer any favor and you're going to make a change anyway at some point. We're here on earth only one time, unless Shirley MacLaine is right, so you ought <span>to </span>be doing something that you enjoy as you go along, and can be enthusiastic about.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">He also says that we should do what we enjoy: "Do what turns you on. Do something that if you had all the money in the world, you'd still be doing it. You've got <span>to </span>have a reason to jump out of bed in the morning...  Don't look for the money. Look for something you love, and if you're good, the money will come.<span>"</span></p>

      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">If <span>we don't hope for much, reality often beats our expectations. </span>If <span>we always expect the best or have unreal expectations, we are often disappointed. We feel worse and make bad judgments.</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2">Expect adversity. We encounter adversity in whatever we choose to do in life. Charles Munger gives his iron prescription for life:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Whenever you think that some situation or some person is ruining your life, it is actually you who are ruining your life... Feeling like a victim is a perfectly <span>disastrous </span>way <span>to </span>go through life. <span>If </span>you just take the attitude that however bad it is in any way, it's <span>always </span>your fault and you just fix it as best you can - the so-called "iron prescription" - I think that really works.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">When bad things happen, ask: What else does this mean? See life's obstacles as temporary setbacks, not disasters. Mark Twain says: "[Our] race, in its poverty, has unquestionably one really effective weapon - laughter... Against the assault oflaughter nothing can stand."</p>

    <p class="calibre2">Let each of us examine his thoughts; he will find them wholly concerned with the past or the future. We almost never think of the present, and if we do think of it, it is only to see what light it throws on our plans for the future. The present is never our end. The past and the present are our means, the future alone our end. Thus we never actually live, but hope to live, and since we are always planning how to be happy, it is inevitable that we should never be so.</p>

      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">Prescriptions for Guaranteed Misery in Life</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Now that Headmaster Berrisford has selected one of the oldest and longest-serving trustees to make a commencement speech, it behooves the speaker to address two questions in every mind:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <ol id="calibre_link-299" class="calibre11">
      <li class="calibre6">
        <p class="calibre2">Why was such a selection made? and,</p>
      </li>
      <li class="calibre6">
        <p class="calibre2">How long is the speech going <span>to </span>last?</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">I will answer the first question from long experience alongside Berrisford. He is seeking enhanced reputation for our school in the manner of the man who proudly displays his horse which can count to seven. The man knows that counting <span>to </span>seven is not much of a mathematical feat but he expects approval because doing so is creditable, considering that the performer is a horse.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">The second question, regarding length of speech, I am not going to answer in advance. <span>It</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2">would deprive your upturned faces oflively curiosity and obvious keen anticipation, which I prefer <span>to </span>retain, regardless of source.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">But I will tell you how my consideration of speech length created the subject matter of the speech itself. I was puffed up when invited to speak. While not having significant public speaking experience, I do hold a black belt in chutzpah, and, I immediately considered Demosthenes and Cicero as role models and anticipated trying to earn a compliment like Cicero gave when asked which was his favorite among the orations of Demosthenes. Cicero replied: "The longest one."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">However, fortunately for this audience, I also thought of Samuel Johnson's famous comment when he addressed Milton's poem, <span>Paradise Lost, </span>and correctly said: "No one ever wished it longer." And that made me consider which of all the twenty Harvard School graduation speeches I had heard that I wished longer. There was only one such speech, that given byJohnny Carson, specifying Carson's prescriptions for guaranteed misery in life. I therefore decided to repeat Carson's speech but in expanded form with some added prescriptions of my own.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">After all, I am much older than Carson was when he spoke and have failed and been miserable more often and in more ways than was possible for a charming humorist speaking at younger age. I am plainly well-qualified to expand on Carson's theme.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">What Carson said was that he couldn't tell the graduating class how <span>to </span>be happy, but he could tell them from personal experience how to guarantee misery. Carson's prescriptions for sure misery included:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">260</p>
    <ol id="calibre_link-300" class="calibre11">
      <li class="calibre6">
        <p class="calibre2">Ingesting chemicals in an effort to alter mood or perception;</p>
      </li>
      <li class="calibre6">
        <p class="calibre2">Envy; and</p>
      </li>
      <li class="calibre6">
        <p class="calibre2">Resentment.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">I can still recall Carson's absolute conviction as he told how he had tried these things on occasion after occasion and had become miserable every time.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">It <span>is easy to understand Carson's first prescription for misery - ingesting chemicals. I add</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2">my voice. The four closest friends of my youth were highly intelligent, ethical, humorous types, favored in person and background. Two are long dead, with alcohol a contributing factor, and a third is a living alcoholic - if you call that living. While susceptibility varies, addiction can happen to any of us, through a subtle process where the bonds of degradation are too light to be felt until they are too strong to be broken. And I have yet to meet anyone, in over six decades of life, whose life was worsened by overfear and overavoidance of such a deceptive pathway to destruction.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Envy, of course, joins chemicals in winning some sort of quantity price for causing misery. It was wreaking havoc long before it got a bad press in the laws of Moses. <span>If </span>you wish to retain the contribution of envy to misery, I recommend that you never read any of the biographies of that good Christian, Samuel Johnson, because his life demonstrates in an enticing way the possibility and advantage of transcending envy.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Resentment has always worked for me exactly as it worked for Carson. I cannot recommend it highly enough to you if you desire misery. Johnson spoke well when he said that life is hard enough to swallow without squeezing in the bitter rind of resentment.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">For those of you who want misery, I also recommend refraining from practice of the Disraeli compromise, designed for people who find it impossible to quit resentment cold turkey. Disraeli, as he rose to become one of the greatest Prime Ministers, learned to give up vengeance as a motivation for action, but he did retain some outlet for resentment by putting the names of people who wronged him on pieces of paper in a drawer. Then, from time to time, he reviewed these names and took pleasure in noting the way the world had taken his enemies down without his assistance.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Well, so much for Carson's three prescriptions. Here are four more prescriptions from Munger:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2"><span>First</span>, be unreliable. Do not faithfully do what you have engaged to do. <span>If </span>you will only master this one habit you will more than counterbalance the combined effect of all your virtues, howsoever great. <span>If </span>you like being distrusted and excluded from the best human contribution and company, this prescription is for you. Master this one habit and you can always play the role of the hare in the fable, except that instead of being outrun by one fine turtle you will be outrun by hordes and hordes of mediocre turtles and even by some mediocre turtles on crutches.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">I must warn you that if you don't follow my first prescription it may be hard to end up miserable, even if you start disadvantaged. I had a roommate in college who was and is severely dyslexic. But he is perhaps the most reliable man I have ever known.

    <p class="calibre2">If <span>you want to avoid a conventional, main-culture, establishment result of this kind, you simply can't count on your other handicaps to hold you back if you persist in being reliable.</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2">I cannot here pass by a reference to a life described as "wonderful so far," without reinforcing the "so far" aspects of the human condition by repeating the remark of Croesus, once the richest king in the world. Later, in ignominious captivity, as he prepared to be burned alive, he said: "Well now do I remember the words of the historian Solon: "No man's life should be accounted a happy one until it is over."</p>

    <p class="calibre2">My <span>second</span> prescription for misery is ro learn everything you possibly can from your own personal experience, minimizing what you learn vicariously from the good and bad experience of others, living and dead. This prescription is a sure-shot producer of misery and second-rate achievement.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">You can see the results of not learning from others' mistakes by simply looking about you. How little originality there is in the common disasters of mankind - drunk driving deaths, reckless driving maimings, incurable venereal diseases, conversion of bright college students into brainwashed zombies as members of destructive cults, business failures through repetition of obvious mistakes made by predecessors, various forms of crowd folly, and so on. I recommend as a memory clue to finding the way to real trouble from heedless, unoriginal error the modern saying: <span>"If </span>at first you don't succeed, well, so much for hang gliding."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">The other aspect of avoiding vicarious wisdom is the rule for not learning from the best work done before yours. The prescription is to become as non-educated as you reasonable can.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Perhaps you will better see the type of non-miserable result you can thus avoid if I render a short historical account. There once was a man who assiduously mastered the work of his best predecessors, despite a poor start and very tough time in analytic geometry. Eventually his own original work attracted wide attention and he said of that work:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">"lfl have seen a little farther than other men it is because I stood on the shoulders of giants."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">The bones of that man lie buried now, in Westminster Abbey, under an unusual inscription:</p>
    <p class="calibre2">"Here lie the remains of all that was mortal in Sir Isaac Newton."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">My <span>third</span> prescription for misery is to go down and stay down when you get your first, second, or third severe reverse in the battle oflife. Because there is so much adversity out there, even for the lucky and wise, this will guarantee that, in due course, you will be permanently mired in misery. Ignore at all cost the lesson contained in the accurate epitaph written for himself by Epicetus: "Here lies Epicetus, a slave, maimed in body, the ultimate in poverty, and favored by the Gods."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">My <span>final</span> prescription <span>to </span>you for a life of fuzzy thinking and infelicity is <span>to </span>ignore a story they told me when I was very young about a rustic who said: "I wish I knew where I was going to die, and then I'd never go there." Most people smile (as you did) at the rustic's ignorance and ignore his basic wisdom. <span>If </span>my experience is any guide, the rustic's approach is to be avoided at all cost by someone bent on misery. To help fail you should discount as mere quirk, with</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">262</p>
    <p class="calibre2">no useful message, the method of the rustic, which is the same one used in Carson's speech. What Carson did was <span>to </span>approach the study of how to create X by turning the question backward, that is, by studying how to create non-X. The great algebraist, Jacobi, had exactly the same approach as Carson and was known for his constant repetition of one phrase: "Invert, always invert." <span>It </span>is in the nature of things, as Jacobi knew, that many hard problems are best solved only when they are addressed backward. For instance, when almost everyone else was trying <span>to </span>revise the electromagnetic laws of Maxwell to be consistent with the motion laws of Newton, Einstein discovered special relativity as he made a 180 degree turn and</p>
    <p class="calibre2">revised Newton's laws to <span>fit </span>Maxwell's.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">It <span>is my opinion, as a certified biography nut, that Charles Robert Darwin would have ranked near the middle of the Harvard School graduating class of 1986. Yet he is now famous in the history of science. This is precisely the type of example you should learn nothing from if bent on minimizing your results from your own endowment.</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2">Darwin's result was due in large measure to his working method, which violated all my rules for misery and particularly emphasized a backward twist in that he always gave priority attention <span>to </span>evidence tending <span>to </span>disconfirm whatever cherished and hard-won theory he already had. In contrast, most people early achieve and later intensify a tendency to process new and disconfirming information so that any original conclusion remains intact. They become people of whom Philip Wylie observed: "You couldn't squeeze a dime between what they already know and what they will never learn."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">The life of Darwin demonstrates how a turtle may outrun the hares, aided by extreme</p>
    <p class="calibre2">objectivity, which helps the objective person end up like the only player without blindfold in a game of pin-the-donkey.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">If <span>you minimize objectivity, you ignore not only a lesson from Darwin but also one from</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2">Einstein. Einstein said that his successful theories came from: "Curiosity, concentration, perseverance and self-criticism. And by self-criticism he meant the testing and destruction of his own well-loved ideas.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Finally, minimizing objectivity will help you lessen the compromises and burdens of owning worldly goods, because objectivity does not work only for great physicists and biologists. <span>It </span>also adds power to the work of a plumbing contractor in Bemidji. Therefore, if you interpret being true to yourself as requiring that you retain every notion of your youth you will be safely underway, not only toward maximizing ignorance, but also toward whatever misery can be obtained through unpleasant experiences in business.</p>
    <p class="calibre2"><span>It </span>is fitting now that a backward sort of speech end with a backward sort of toast, inspired by Elihu Root's repeated accounts of how the dog went <span>to </span>Dover, "leg over leg." To the class of 1986:</p>

    <p class="calibre2">On how to change people</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Suppose you've got a client who really wants to commit tax fraud. <span>If </span>he doesn't push the tax law away beyond the line, he can't <span>stand </span>it. He can't shave in the morning if he thinks there's been any cheating he could get by with that he hasn't done. And there are people like that. They just feel they aren't living aggressively enough.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">You can approach that situation in either of two ways: (A) you can say, "I just won't work for him," and duck it. Or, (B) you can say, "Well, the circumstances of my life require that I work for him. And what <span>Tm </span>doing for him doesn't involve my cheating. Therefore, I'll do it." And if you see he wants to do something really stupid, it probably won't work to tell him,</p>
    <p class="calibre2">"What you're doing is bad. I have better morals than you."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">That <span>offends </span>him. You're young. He's old. Therefore, instead of being persuaded, he's more likely to react with, "Who in the hell are you to establish the moral code of the whole world?" But instead, you can say to him, "You can't do that without three other people beneath you knowing about it. Therefore, you're making yourself subject to <span>blackmail. </span>You're risking your</p>
    <p class="calibre2">reputation. <span>You're risking your </span>family, <span>your </span>money, <span>etc."</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2">That is likely to <span>work. </span>And you're telling him something that's <span>true. </span>Do you want to spend a lot of time working for people where you have to use methods like that to get them to behave well? I think the answer is <span>no. </span>But if you're hooked with it, appealing to <span>interest </span>is likely to work better as a matter of human persuasion than appeal to anything else. That, again, is a powerful psychological principle with deep biological roots.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">I saw that psychological principle totally blown at Salomon. Salomon's general council <span>knew </span>that the CEO, Gutfreund, should have promptly told the Federal authorities all about Salomon's trading improprieties in which Gutfreund didn't participate and which he hadn't caused. And the general counsel urged Gutfreund to do it. He told Gutfreund, in effect, "You're probably not legally required to do that, but it's the right thing to do. You really should."</p>
    <p class="calibre2">But it didn't work. The task was easy to put off - because it was unpleasant. So that's what Gutfreund did - he put it off.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">And the general counsel had very little constituency within Salomon <span>except </span>for the CEO. <span>If </span>the CEO went down, the general counsel was going down with him. Therefore, his whole career was on the line. So to save his career, he needed to talk the dilatory CEO into doing the right thing.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">It would've been child's play to get that job done right. All the general counsel had to do was to tell his boss, "John, this situation could ruin your <span>life. </span>You could lose your <span>wealth. </span>You could lose your <span>reputation... </span>"And it would have <span>worked. </span>CEOs don't <span>like </span>the idea of being</p>

    <p class="calibre2">On some reasons to <span>why </span>managers don't make rational decisions</p>
    <p class="calibre2">My most surprising discovery: the overwhelming importance in business of an unseen force that we might call "the institutional imperative." In business school, I was given no hint of the imperative's existence and I did  not intuitively understand it when I entered the business world. I thought then that decent, intelligent, and experienced managers would automatically make rational business decisions. But I learned over time that isn't so. Instead, rationality frequently wilts when the institutional imperative comes into play.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">For example: <span>(1) </span>As if governed by Newton's First Law of Motion, an institution will resist any change in its current direction; (2) Just as work expands to fill available time, corporate projects or acquisitions will materialize to soak up available funds; (3) Any business craving of the leader, however foolish, will be quickly supported by detailed rate-of-return and strategic studies prepared by his troops; and (4) The behavior of peer companies, whether they are expanding, acquiring, setting executive compensation or whatever, will be mindlessly imitated.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Institutional dynamics, not venality or stupidity, set businesses on these courses, which are too often misguided. After making some expensive mistakes because I ignored the power of the imperative, I have tried to organize and manage Berkshire in ways that minimize its influence. Furthermore, Charlie and I have attempted to concentrate our investments in companies that appear alert to the problem.

    <p class="calibre2">On the difficulty of replacing a CEO</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Most organizations depend on the self-interest of the superior to weed out the second-rate inferior. <span>If </span>I'm a sales manager and I've got lots of lousy salesmen, it hurts <span>my </span>performance and it probably hurts my income to keep on the sub-par performers. It certainly hurts a football coach to keep a sub-par quarterback or any other player in there ifhe can get a better one. In almost all jobs, there is a reward or penalty system that causes the superior to think actively about whether the people beneath him are doing a first-class job and to do something about it if they aren't.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">That works all the way up to the CEO. But the CEO's superiors are the directors of the publicly held company. And are the directors of the company going to suffer if the CEO is sub-par? Probably only if they're embarrassed. That's the way you hurt the superior in that case. You don't take away his directors' fee. And as a practical matter, you don't displace directors very often. So the only system that's comparable to the problem of the football coach or the sales manager is probably to hurt psychically the position of the inferior director</p>
    <p class="calibre2">- and that will work. Otherwise, the motivation to correct the CEO problem is not strong unless there's a big ownership among directors - and even that doesn't always work perfectly. To change directors usually takes the action of big shareholders. It doesn't happen any other way. It's a very awkward situation for a management or a group of directors, who have somehow selected other weak directors, to make changes. It goes against all the natural</p>

    <p class="calibre2">I have been asked by a number of people just what secrets the Blumkins [Nebraska Furniture Mart] bring to their business. These are not very esoteric. All members of the family: (1) apply themselves with an enthusiasm and energy that would make Ben Franklin and Horatio Alger look like dropouts; (2) define with extraordinary realism their area of special competence and act decisively on all matters within it; (3) ignore even the most enticing propositions falling outside of that area of special competence; and (4) unfailingly behave in a high-grade manner with everyone they deal with.

    <p class="calibre2">We want people joining us who already are the type that face reality and that basically [not only] tell us the truth, but tell themselves the truth - which is even more important. Once you get an organization that lies to itself- and there are plenty that do - I just think you get into all kinds of problems. And people know it throughout the organization and they adopt the norms of what they think is happening up above them. Particularly in a financial organization - really in any organization, but particularly in a financial organization - that is death over time. We wouldn't buy into something that we felt had that problem with the idea that we would correct it - because we wouldn't. We've had a little experience with some organizations that have had that sort of problem. And it's not correctable - at least based on the life span of humans. It's too much to commit to.

    <p class="calibre2">We find it meaningful when an owner <span>cares </span>about whom he sells to. We like to do business with someone who loves his company, not just the money that a sale will bring him (though we certainly understand why he likes that as well). When chis emotional attachment exists, it signals that important qualities will likely be found within the business: honest accounting, pride of product, respect for customers, and a loyal group of associates having a strong sense of direction. The reverse is apt to be true, also. When an owner auctions off his business, exhibiting a total lack of interest in what follows, you will frequently find that it has been dressed up for sale, particularly when the seller is a "financial owner." And if owners behave with little regard for their business and its people, their conduct will often contaminate attitudes and practices throughout the company.

    <p class="calibre2"><span>Buffett</span>: It <span>does </span>pay to have the right models.. <span>.I </span>think that it just stands to reason that if you copy the people that you look up to - particularly if you do it at an early enough age... <span>If </span>you influence the role models of a five-year old or an eight-year old or a ten-year old, then it's going to have a huge impact.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">And of course, virtually everybody starts out with their initial models being their parents. So they are the ones that are going to have a <span>huge </span>effect on 'em. And if that parent turns out to be a great model, I think it's going to be a huge plus for the child. I think it beats a whole lot of other things in life to have the right models around...</p>
    <p class="calibre2">But you've got <span>to </span>start early. It's very tough <span>to </span>change behavior later on. <span>I </span>tell the students</p>
    <p class="calibre2">in classes, "Just pick out the person you admire the most in the class, and sit down and write the reasons why you admire him and then try and figure out why you can't have the same qualities." After all, they're not like the ability to throw a football 60 yards or run the 100 in ten seconds flat or something like that. They're qualities of personality, character and temperament that <span>can </span>be emulated.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">And you can apply the reverse ofit following Charlie's theory: You can find the people you don't like and say, "What <span>don't </span><span>I </span>like about these people?" It takes a little strength of character, but you can look inwards and say, "Have <span>I </span>got some of that in me?"</p>
    <p class="calibre2">It's not complicated. Ben Graham did it, Ben Franklin did it. And nothing could be more simple than <span>to </span>try and figure out what you find admirable and then decide that the person you <span>really </span>would like to admire is <span>yourself </span>And the only way you're going to do it is to take on the qualities of other people you admire.</p>

    <p class="calibre2">About <span>99% </span>of American management thinks that if they're wonderful at doing one thing that they'll be wonderful at doing something else. They're like a duck on a pond when it's raining</p>
    <p class="calibre2">- they're going up in the world. They start thinking that they're the ones that are causing themselves to rise. So they go over to some place where it isn't raining and they just sit there on the ground. But nothing happens. Then they usually fire their number rwo in command or hire a consultant. They very seldom see what really happens is that they have left their circle of competence ...</p>

    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">On some reasons to why bad lending happen so often</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Granting the presence of perverse incentives, what are the operating mechanics that cause widespread bad loans (where the higher interest rates do not adequately cover increased risk ofloss) under our present system? After all, the bad lending, while it has a surface plausibility to bankers under cost pressure, is, by definition, not rational, at least for the lending banks and the wider civilization. How then does bad lending occur so often?</p>
    <p class="calibre2">It occurs (partly) because there are predictable irrationalities among people as social animals. <span>It </span>is now pretty clear (in experimental social psychology) that people on the horns of a dilemma, which is where our system has placed our bankers, are extra likely to react unwisely <span>to </span>the example of other people's conduct, now widely called "social prooÂ£" So, once some banker has apparently (but not really) solved his cost-pressure problem by unwise lending, a considerable amount of imitative "crowd folly," relying on the "social proof," is the natural consequence. Additional massive irrational lending is caused by "reinforcement" of foolish behavior, caused by unwise accounting convention in a manner discussed later in this letter. <span>It </span>is hard to be wise when the messages which drive you are wrong messages provided by a mal-designed system ...</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Many eminent "experts" would not agree with our notions about systemic irresponsibility from combining <span>(1) </span>"free-market" pricing of interest rates with (2) government guarantees of payment. <span>If </span>many eminent "experts" are wrong, how could this happen? Our explanation is that the "experts" are over-charmed with an admirable, powerful, predictive model, coming down from Adam Smith. Those discretionary interest rates on deposits have a "free-market"</p>
    <p class="calibre2">image, making it easy to conclude, automatically, that the discretionary rates, like other free market processes, must be good. Indeed, they are appraised as remaining good even when combined with governmental deposit insurance, a radical non-free-market element.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Such illogical thinking displays the standard folly bedeviling the "expert" role in any soft science: one tends to use only models from one's own segment of a discipline, ignoring or underweighing others. Furthermore, the more powerful and useful is any model, the more error it tends to produce through overconfident misuse.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">This brings to mind Ben Graham's paradoxical observation that good ideas cause more investment mischief than bad ideas. He had it right. It is so easy for us all <span>to </span>push a really good idea to wretched excess, as in the case of the Florida land bubble or the "nifty fifty" corporate stocks. Then mix in a little "social proof" (from other experts), and brains (including ours) often turn to mush. It would be nice if great old models never tricked us, but, alas, "some dreams are not <span>to </span>be." Even Einstein got tricked in his later years...</p>
    <p class="calibre2">We think current accounting for many high-interest-rate loans has terrible consequences in the banking system. In essence, it "front ends" into reported income revenues that would have been deferred until much later, after risky bets were more clearly won, if more</p>

    <p class="calibre2"><a id="calibre_link-309">conservative accounting had been employed. This practice turns many a banker into a human version of one of B.F. Skinner's pigeons, since he is "reinforced" into continuing and expanding bad lending through the pleasure of seeing good figures in the short term. The good figures substitute nicely in the mind for nonexistent underlying institutional good, partly through the process, originally demonstrated by Pavlov, wherein we respond to a mere association because it has usually portended a reality that would make the response correct.

    <p class="calibre2">On the value of math</p>
    <p class="calibre2">53% of the world's stock market value is in the U.S. Well, if U.S. GDP [gross domestic product] grows at 4-5% a year with 1-2% inflation - which would be a pretty good, in fact it would be a <span>very </span>good result - then I think it's very unlikely that corporate profits are going to grow at a greater rate than that. Corporate profits as a percent of GDP are on the high side already- and corporate profits can't constantly grow at a faster rate than GDP. Obviously, in the end, they'd be greater than GDP.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">It's like somebody said about New York - that it has more lawyers than people. You run into certain conflicts as you go along if you say profits can get bigger than GDP. So if you have a situation where the best you can hope for in corporate profit growth over the years is 4-5%, how can it be reasonable to think that equities - which, after all, are a capitalization of those corporate profits - can grow at 15% a year? It's <span>nonsense, </span>frankly...</p>
    <p class="calibre2">The other day, I looked at the <span>Fortune </span>500. And the companies on that list earned $334 billion and had a market capitalization of $9.9 trillion at year end - which would probably be up to at least $10.5 trillion now. Well, the only money investors are going to make in the long run is what the businesses make. There's nothing added. The government doesn't throw in anything. Nobody's adding to the pot. People take <span>out </span>from the pot in terms of frictional costs - investment management fees, brokerage commissions and all of that. But $334 billion is all that the investment earns.</p>
    <p class="calibre2"><span>If </span>you own a farm, what the farm produces is all you're going to get from the farm. <span>If </span>it produces $50 an acre of net profit, you'll get $50 an acre of net profit. And there's nothing about it that transforms that in some miraculous form. <span>If </span>you owned all of the <span>Fortune </span>500</p>
    <p class="calibre2">- if you owned 100% ofit -you'd be making $334 billion. And if you paid $10.5 trillion for that, well, that's not a great return on investment.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Then you might say, "Can that $334 billion double in five years?" Well, it <span>can't </span>double in five years with GDP growing at 4% a year or some number like that. It would just produce things so out of whack in terms of experience in the American economy that it won't happen. Any time you get involved in these things where if you trace out the mathematics of it, you bump into absurdities, then you better change your expectations somewhat.

    <p class="calibre2">On advantages of scale</p>
    <p class="calibre2">In terms of which businesses succeed and which businesses fail, advantages of scale are</p>
    <p class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
    </p>
    <p class="calibre2">269</p>
    <p class="calibre2">ungodly important. For example, one great advantage of scale taught in all of the business schools of the world is cost reductions along the so-called experience curve. Just <span>doing </span>something complicated in more and more volume enables human beings, who are trying to improve and are motivated by the incentives of capitalism, to do it more and more <span>efficiently. </span>The very nature of things is that if you get a whole lot of volume through your joint, you get better at processing that volume. That's an enormous advantage. And it has a lot to do</p>
    <p class="calibre2">with which businesses succeed and fail....</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Let's go through a list - albeit an incomplete one of possible advantages of scale. Some come from simple geometry. <span>If </span>you're building a great spherical tank, obviously as you build it bigger, the amount of steel you use in the surface goes up with the square and the cubic volume goes up with the cube. So as you increase the dimensions, you can hold a lot more volume per unit area of steel. And there are all kinds of things like that where the simple geometry - the simple reality- gives you an advantage of scale.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">For example, you can get advantages of scale from TV advertising. When TV advertising first arrived - when talking color pictures first came into our living rooms - it was an unbelievably powerful thing. And in the early days, we had three networks that had whatever it was - say 90% of the audience.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Well, if you were Proctor <span>&amp; </span>Gamble, you could afford <span>to </span>use this new method of</p>
    <p class="calibre2">advertising. You could afford the very expensive cost of network television because you were selling so damn many cans and bottles. Some little guy couldn't. And there was no way of buying it in part. Therefore, he couldn't use it. In effect, if you didn't have a big volume, you couldn't use network TV advertising - which was the most effective technique.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">So when TV came in, the branded companies that were already big got a <span>huge </span>tail wind.</p>
    <p class="calibre2">Indeed, they prospered and prospered and prospered until some of them got fat and foolish, which happens with prosperity- at least <span>to </span>some people....</p>
    <p class="calibre2">And your advantage of scale can be an informational advantage. <span>If </span>I go <span>to </span>some remote</p>
    <p class="calibre2">place, I may see Wrigley chewing gum alongside Glotz's chewing gum. Well, I know that Wrigley is a satisfactory product, whereas I don't know anything about Glotz's. So if one is</p>
    <p class="calibre2">$.40 and the other is $.30, am I going <span>to </span>take something I don't know and put it in my mouth</p>
    <ul id="calibre_link-311" class="calibre5">
      <li class="calibre6">
        <p class="calibre2">which is a pretty personal place, after all - for a lousy dime?</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Another advantage of scale comes from psychology We are all influenced - subconsciously</p>
        <p class="calibre2">and to some extent consciously- by what we see others do and approve. Therefore, if everybody's buying something, we think it's better. We don't like <span>to </span>be the one guy who's out of step.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Again, some of this is at a subconscious level and some of it isn't. Sometimes, we consciously and rationally think, "Gee, I don't know much about this. They know more than I do. Therefore, why shouldn't I follow them?"</p>
        <p class="calibre2">The social proof phenomenon which comes right out of psychology gives huge advantages to scale - for example, with very wide distribution, which of course is hard <span>to </span>get. One advantage of Coca-Cola is that it's available almost everywhere in the world.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Well, suppose you have a little soft drink. Exactly how do you make it available all over the Earth? The worldwide distribution setup - which is slowly won by a big enterprise - gets to be a <span>huge </span>advantage And if you think about it, once you get enough advantages of that</p>
        <p class="calibre2">type, it can become very hard for anybody <span>to </span>dislodge you. 270</p>
        <p class="calibre2"><a id="calibre_link-312">There's </a><span>another </span>kind of advantage to scale. In some businesses, the very nature of things is to sort of cascade toward the overwhelming dominance of one firm.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">The most obvious one is daily newspapers. There's practically no city left in the U.S., aside from a few very big ones, where there's more than one daily newspaper.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">And again, that's a scale thing. Once I get most of the circulation, I get most of the advertising. And once I get most of the advertising and circulation, why would anyone want the thinner paper with less information in it? So it tends to cascade to a winner-take-all situation. And chat's a separate form of the advantages of scale phenomenon.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Similarly, all these huge advantages of scale allow greater specialization within the firm. Therefore, each person can be better at what he does...</p>
        <p class="calibre2">On the subject of advantages of economies of scale, I find chain stores quite interesting. Just think about it. The concept of a chain store was a fascinating invention. You get this huge purchasing power - which means chat you have lower merchandise costs. You get a whole bunch oflittle laboratories out there in which you can conduct experiments. And you get specialization. <span>If </span>one little guy is trying to buy across 27 different merchandise categories influenced by traveling salesmen, he's going to make a lot of dumb decisions. But if your buying is done in headquarters for a huge bunch of stores, you can get very bright people chat know a lot about</p>
        <p class="calibre2">refrigerators and so forth to do the buying.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">The reverse is demonstrated by the little store where one guy is doing all the buying. It's like the old story about the little store with salt all over its walls. And a stranger comes in and says to the store owner, "You must sell a lot of salt." And he replies, "No, I don't. But you should see the guy who <span>sells </span>me salt."

        <p class="calibre2">
          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">On disadvantages of scale</p>
        <p class="calibre2">For example, we - by which I mean Berkshire Hathaway - are the largest shareholder in Capital Cities/ABC. And we had trade publications there that got murdered - where our competitors beat us. And the way they beat us was by going to a narrower specialization.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">We'd have a travel magazine for business travel. So somebody would create one which was addressed solely at corporate travel departments. Like an ecosystem, you're getting a narrower and narrower specialization.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Well, they got much more efficient. They could tell more to the guys who ran corporate travel departments. Plus, they didn't have to waste the ink and paper mailing out stuff that corporate travel departments weren't interested in reading. <span>It </span>was a more efficient system. And they beat our brains out as we relied on our broader magazine.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">That's what happened to <span>The Saturday Evening Post </span>and all chose things. They're gone. What we have now is <span>Motorcross- </span>which is read by a bunch of nuts who like to participate in tournaments where they turn somersaults on their motorcycles. But they <span>care </span>about it. For them, it's the principal purpose of life. A magazine called <span>Motorcross </span>is a total necessity to those people. And its profit margins would make you salivate. Just think of how narrowcast chat kind of publishing is. So occasionally, scaling <span>down </span>and intensifying gives you the big advantage. Bigger is not always better.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">
          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />

        <p class="calibre2">271</p>
        <p class="calibre2">
          <a id="calibre_link-313">The great defect of scale, of course, which makes the game interesting - so that the big people don't always win - is that as you get big, you get the bureaucracy. And with the bureaucracy comes the territoriality- which is again grounded in human nature.</a>
          <a id="calibre_link-314">â</a>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">And the incentives are perverse. For example, if you worked for AT&amp;T in my day, it was a great bureaucracy. Who in the hell was really thinking about the shareholder or anything else? And in a bureaucracy, you think the work is done when it goes out of your in-basket into somebody's else's in-basket. But, of course, it isn't. It's not done until AT&amp;T delivers what it's supposed to deliver. So you get big, fat, dumb, unmotivated bureaucracies.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">They also tend to become somewhat corrupt. In other words, ifl've got a department and you've got a department and we kind of share power running this thing, there's sort of an unwritten rule: <span>"If </span>you won't bother me, I won't bother you and we're both happy." So you get layers of management and associated costs that nobody needs. Then, while people are justifying all these layers. It takes forever <span>to </span>get anything done. They're too slow to make decisions and nimbler people run circles around them.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">The constant curse of scale is that it leads to big, dumb bureaucracy - which, of course, reaches its highest and worst form in government where the incentives are <span>really </span>awful. That doesn't mean we don't need governments - because we do. But it's a <span>terrible </span>problem to get big bureaucracies to behave.

        <p class="calibre2">On how to get worldly wisdom</p>
        <p class="calibre2">I've long believed that a certain system - which almost any intelligent person can learn - works way better than the systems that <span>most </span>people use. As I said at the U.S.C. Business School, what you need is a latticework of mental models in your head. And you hang your actual experience and your vicarious experience (that you get from reading and so forth) on this latticework of powerful models. And, with that system, things gradually get to fit together in a way that enhances cognition.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">And you need the models - not just from one or two disciplines, but from <i class="calibre4">all </i>the important disciplines. You need the best 100 or so models from microeconomics, physiology, psychology particularly, elementary mathematics, hard science and engineering [and so on].</p>
        <p class="calibre2">You don't have to be a huge expert in any of those fields. All you've got to do is take the really <span>big </span>ideas and learn them early and well.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">You <span>can't </span>learn those 100 big ideas you really need the way many students do - where you learn 'em well enough to bang 'em back to the professor and get your grade and then you empty them out as though you were emptying a bathtub so you can take in more water next time. <span>If </span><span>that's </span>the way you learn the 100 big models you're going to need, [you'll be] an "also ran" in the game of life. You have to learn the models so that they become part of your ever used repertoire.

        <p class="calibre2">On what something really mean</p>
        <p class="calibre2">By its nature, the U.S. is running a substantial merchandise trade deficit. <span>If </span>you buy more</p>
        <p class="calibre2">
          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">272</p>
        <p class="calibre2">
          <a id="calibre_link-315">from the rest of the world than you're selling them - which is what happens by definition when you're running a trade deficit - you have to balance the books. They have to get something - some capital asset - in exchange: They may get a government bond. They may get a piece of a U.S. business. But they have to get </a>
          <span>something.</span>
          <a id="calibre_link-316">â</a>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">The <span>key </span>thing in economics, whenever someone makes an assertion to you, is to always</p>
        <p class="calibre2">ask, "And <span>then </span>what?" Actually, it's not such a bad idea to ask it about <span>everything. </span>But you should always ask, "And then what?"</p>
        <p class="calibre2">So when you read that the merchandise trade deficit is $9 billion, what <span>else </span>does that mean? It means that somehow we must also have traded $9 billion of capital assets - (future) claims on <span>our </span>production - and given them to somebody else in the world. So they <span>have </span>to invest. They don't have any choice. And when somebody says, "Won't it be terrible if the Japanese sell all of their government bonds?" Well, they <span>can't </span>without getting <span>another </span>American asset in exchange. There's simply no other way to <span>do </span>it. They could sell it to the French, but then the French have the same problem.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">On 3 timeless ideas for investing</p>
        <p class="calibre2">His [Benjamin Graham] three basic ideas - and none of them are complicated or require any mathematical talent or anything of that sort - are:</p>
        <ol id="calibre_link-317" class="calibre14">
          <li class="calibre6">
            <p class="calibre2">that you should look at stocks as part ownership of a business,</p>
          </li>
          <li class="calibre6">
            <p class="calibre2">that you should look at market fluctuations in terms of his "Mr. Market" example and make them your friend rather than your enemy by essentially profiting from folly rather participating in it, and finally,</p>
          </li>
          <li class="calibre6">
            <p class="calibre2">the three most important words in investing are "margin of safety" - ... always building a 15,000 pound bridge if you're going to be driving 10,000 pound truck across it ...</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="calibre2">So I think that it comes down to those ideas - although they sound so simple and commonplace that it kind of seems like a waste to go to school and get a Ph.D. in Economics and have it all come back to that. It's a little like spending eight years in divinity school and having somebody tell you that the ten commandments were all that counted. There is a certain natural tendency to overlook anything that simple and important.

        <p class="calibre2">On how to evaluate businesses</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Leaving aside tax factors, the formula we use for evaluating stocks and businesses is identical. Indeed, the formula for valuing <i class="calibre4">all </i>assets that are purchased for financial gain has been unchanged since it was first laid out bya very smart man in about 600 B.C. (though he wasn't smart enough to know it was 600 B.C.).</p>
        <p class="calibre2">The oracle was Aesop and his enduring, though somewhat incomplete, investment insight was "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush." To flesh out this principle, you must answer</p>

        <p class="calibre2">273</p>
        <p class="calibre2"><a id="calibre_link-318">only three questions. How certain are you that there are indeed birds in the bush? When will they emerge and how many will there be? What is the risk-free interest rate (which we consider to be the yield on long-term U.S. bonds)? </a><span>If </span>you can answer these three questions, you will know the maximum value of the bush - and the maximum number of the birds you now possess that should be offered for it. And, of course, don't literally think birds. Think dollars.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">applies to outlays for farms, oil royalties, bonds, stocks, lottery tickets, and manufacturing plants. And neither the advent of the steam engine, the harnessing of electricity nor the creation of the automobile changed the formula one iota - nor will the Internet. Just insert the correct numbers, and you can rank the attractiveness of all possible uses of capital throughout the universe.

        <p class="calibre2">On commodity businesses</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Businesses in industries with both substantial over-capacity and a "commodity" product (undifferentiated in any customer-important way by factors such as performance, appearance, service support, etc.) are prime candidates for profit troubles. These may be escaped, true, if prices or costs are administered in some manner and thereby insulated at least partially from normal market forces. This administration can be carried out (a) legally through government intervention (until recently, this category included pricing for truckers and deposit costs for financial institutions), (b) illegally through collusion, or (c) "extra legally" through OPEC-style foreign cartelization (with tag-along benefits for domestic non cartel operators).</p>
        <p class="calibre2">If, <span>however, costs and prices are determined by full-bore competition, there is more than</span></p>
        <p class="calibre2">ample capacity, and the buyer cares little about whose product or distribution services he uses, industry economics are almost certain to be unexciting. They may well be disastrous.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Hence the constant struggle of every vendor to establish and emphasize special qualities of product or service. This works with candy bars (customers buy by brand name, not by asking for a "two-ounce candy bar") but doesn't work with sugar (how often do you hear, "I'll have a cup of coffee with cream and C <span>&amp; </span>H sugar, please").</p>
        <p class="calibre2">In many industries, differentiation simply can't be made meaningful. A few producers in such industries may consistently do well if they have a cost advantage that is both wide and sustainable. By definition such exceptions are few, and, in many industries, are non-existent. For the great majority of companies selling "commodity" products, a depressing equation of business economics prevails: persistent over-capacity without administered prices (or costs) equals poor profitability.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Of course, over-capacity may eventually self-correct, either as capacity shrinks or demand expands. Unfortunately for the participants, such corrections often are long delayed. When they finally occur, the rebound to prosperity frequently produces a pervasive enthusiasm for expansion that, within a few years, again creates over-capacity and a new profitless environment. In other words, nothing fails like success.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">What finally determines levels of long-term profitability in such industries is the ratio of supply-tight to supply-ample years. Frequently that ratio is dismal. (It seems as if the most</p>

          <a id="calibre_link-320">â</a>
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">In some industries, however, capacity-tight conditions can last a long time. Sometimes actual growth in demand will outrun forecasted growth for an extended period. In other cases, adding capacity requires very long lead times because complicated manufacturing facilities must be planned and built.

          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">On paying cash out or keeping it in the business</p>
        <p class="calibre2">When we have capital around, we have three questions... First, "Does it make more sense to pay it out to the shareholders than to keep it within the company?" The sub-question on that is, <span>"If </span>we pay it out, is it better off to do it via repurchases or via dividend?" The test for whether we pay it out in dividends is, "Can we create more than a dollar of value within the company with that dollar by retaining it rather than paying it out?"</p>
        <p class="calibre2">And you never <span>know </span>the answer to that. But so far, the answer, as judged by our results, is, "Yes, we can". And we think that prospectively we can. But that's a hope on our part. It's justified to some extent by past history, but it's not a certainty.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Once we've crossed <span>that </span>threshold, then we ask ourselves, "Should we repurchase stock?"</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Well, obviously, if you can buy your stock at a significant discount from conservatively calculated intrinsic value and you can buy a reasonable quantity, <span>that's </span>a sensible use for capital.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Beyond that, the question becomes, <span>"If </span>you have the capital and you think that you can create more than a dollar, how do you create the most value with the least risk?"

        <p class="calibre2">On the real risk of investing</p>
        <p class="calibre2">In our opinion, the real risk that an investor must assess is whether his aggregate after-tax receipts from an investment (including those he receives on sale) will, over his prospective holding period, give him at least as much purchasing power as he had to begin with, plus a modest rate of interest on  that initial stake. Though this risk cannot be calculated with engineering precision, it can in some cases be judged with a degree of accuracy that is useful. The  primary factors bearing upon this evaluation are:</p>

And it's the most important thing that will happen <span>to </span>you in your life, but you have no control over it.

That's because you're going <span>to </span>want to have a system that turns out great quantities of goods and services, so that your kids can live better than you did, and so that your grandchildren can live better than your kids. You're going <span>to </span>want a system that keeps Bill Gates and Andy Grove and Jack Welch working long, long after they don't need to work. You're going to want the most able people working more than 12 hours a day. So you've got to have a system that incentives them, and that turns out goods.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">But you're also going <span>to </span>want a system that takes care of the bad balls, the ones that aren't lucky. <span>If </span>you have a system that is turning out enough goods and services, you can take care of them. You want a system where people are free of fear <span>to </span>some extent. You don't want people worrying about being sick in their old age, or fearful about going home at night. So you'll try to design something, assuming you have the goods and services <span>to </span>solve that sort of thing. You'll want equaliry of opportunity- a good public school system - <span>to </span>make you feel that every piece of talent out there will get the same shot at contributing. And your tax system will follow from your reasoning on that.

        <p class="calibre2">
          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">Blaise Pascal and Pierre Fermat developed the fundamental principles of probability in a series ofletters exchanged starting in the year 1654.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">Definitions</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Experiment<span> is the process of obtaining an observation. For example: </span><span>Toss a coin twice and observe what happens.</span></p>
        <p class="calibre2"><span>Outcome</span><span> is the possible result of the experiment. All possible outcomes of the experiment are called the sample space. </span>The experiment of tossing a coin twice results in one of four possible outcomes <span>- </span>Tail/Tail Head/Head, Head/Tail, or Tail/Head.</p>
        <p class="calibre2"><span>Event</span> is a set of outcomes of the experiment. One event would be: <span>Observe at least one head. This event consists of the three outcomes HH, HT, TH </span>A compound event is an event composed of two or more separate events.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Independent events<span> - two events A and Bare independent if no event can influence the probability of the other. </span><span>Event A: observe one head when flipping a coin. Event B: observe one tail when flipping another coin. Each flip is independent of the other since whatever happens to the first coin cannot influence the flip of the second or tell us what outcome is likely to happen when we flip the second coin.</span></p>
        <p class="calibre2"><span>Mutually exclusive events</span> - two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot happen at the same time i.e. they have no outcomes in common. <span>A single coin is tossed. There are two events: observing a head or observing a tail. Observing a head excludes the possibility of observing a tail. </span>Two events are non-mutually exclusive if they have one or more outcomes in common. <span>A </span><span>single die is tossed. Event A: observe a four. Event B: observe an even number. These events have one outcome in common since an "even number" consists of the numbers 2, 4, and </span><span>6.</span></p>
        <p class="calibre2"><span>Probability</span> - a number between <span>O </span>and I that measures how likely an event is <span>to </span>happen over the long run. A probability of I means an event happens with certainty and a probability of <span>O </span>means it is impossible for an event to happen.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Arithmetic mean<span> of a set of outcomes is usually called the average value of these outcomes. </span><span>To</span></p>
        <p class="calibre2">find the mean of the numbers 1,8,6,4,7, we add the numbers together-26-and divide <span>by </span>5 <span>= </span>5.2.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Variability<span> shows how concentrated or spread out the outcomes are around the arithmetic mean.</span></p>
        <p class="calibre2">Expectation<span> is the average value we expect to observe if we perform a large number of experiments. Also called expected value- the probability-weighted sum of all possible outcomes.</span></p>
        <p class="calibre2"><span>Population</span> - the total number of something - outcomes, objects, events, etc. <span>It </span>is a group that has at least one characteristic in common from which our sample of data is selected.</p>

          <span> - a representative and randomly taken part of the population that is studied in order to draw conclusions about the population. The larger the sample, the better our estimate of the probability. But observe that what is essential is the absolute size of the sample (e.g. the number of people  who've been asked), not its proportion of  the population. A random sample of 3,000 from the entire U.S. is more predictive than a sample of 40 from a particular university. A random sample is one in which every item in the population is equally likely to be chosen.</span>

        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">How do we decide the probability of an event?</p>
        <p class="calibre2">The laws of probability tell us what is likely <span>to </span>happen over a large number of trials. This means we can expect <span>to </span>make reasonable predictions what on average are likely <span>to </span>happen over the long run, but we can't predict the outcome of a particular event.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">There are three ways <span>to </span>measure probability: the logical way, the relative frequency way, and the subjective way.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">
          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">The <span>logical way</span></p>
        <p class="calibre2">The logical way can be used in situations where we know the number of outcomes and where all these outcomes are equally likely. For example in games of chance, we find the probability by dividing the number of outcomes that are favorable <span>to </span>the event (yield the outcome we look for) with the total number of possible outcomes. Observe that this definition can only be applied if we can analyze a situation into equally likely outcomes.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">What is the probability that we observe one head when tossing a coin? The number of equally likely favorable outcomes is one (head) and the total number of possible equally likely outcomes is two (head and tail) and therefore the probability isÂ½ or 50%.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">
          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">Relative frequency</p>
        <p class="calibre2">When an experiment can be repeated many times, probability is the proportion of times the event happened in relation to an infinite number of experiments. In most cases we don't know the probability of an event. Why? Because we can't know all the outcomes. We must then try to estimate the long-term relative frequency by performing experiments or by finding representative information about how often an event happened in the past.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">By representative we mean that the information must be based on the relative frequency of historical data over a large number of independent experiments or observations of the same reference class under essentially the same conditions. The reference class is the one for which the distribution of outcomes is known or can be reasonable estimated. The more relevant cases we examine, the better our chance is <span>to </span>estimate correctly the underlying probability.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">Conduct an experiment to test how likely it is that you toss head. Toss a coin 1000 times and observe what happens. Jfyou got heads 400 times the relative frequency or the fraction between the number of tossed heads (number of times the events happened) and the total number of tosses (number of experiments) is 400/1000. Toss a coin 2000 times and observe what happens. <span>If </span>you got heads 900 times the relative frequency is 900/2000. The more tosses, the less the difference will be between an events theoretical probability and the relative frequency with which it happens. In this case it will move towards the value <span>Â½.</span></p>

        <p class="calibre2"><a id="calibre_link-329"><span>What is the frequency of losses? How are losses distributed over time? What is their magnitude? </span></a>Insurance companies use relative frequencies. They base their premiums on an estimate of how likely it is that a specific event that cause them to pay happen. <span>If </span>they assume the past is a representative guide for the future they try to find out the relative frequency of a specific "accident" by observing past frequencies of specific accidents.<a id="calibre_link-330">â</a></p>
        <p class="calibre2">Suppose the probability that a given house will burn is 0.3%. This means that the insurance company found historical data and other indicators about a large number of houses (for example the reference class is "50 years of data of fires in a given area'') and discovered that, in the past, 3 out of 1,000 houses in a given area will burn. It also means that, assuming there are no changes in the causes of these fires, we can predict approximately the same proportion of fires in the foture. <span>An insurance company knows that in a given year a certain percentage of their policyholders will have an accident. They don't know which ones, but they diversify their risk by insuring many individuals. What is unpredictable for one person can be predictable for a large population. But they must make sure the events are independent and that not a single event or a confluence ofindependent events affects multiple policyholders causing the insurer to pay out on many claims at one time. For example, an insurance company who provides fire insurance to a number of buildings in a single block may face ruin if a large fire happens.</span></p>

          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">Subjective probability</p>
        <p class="calibre2">If <span>an experiment is not repeatable or when there is no representative historical relative frequency, or comparable data, the probability is then a measure of our personal degree of belief in the likelihood of an event happening. We have to make a subjective evaluation or a personal estimation using whatever information is available. But we can't just assign any number to events. They must agree with the rules of probability.</span></p>

          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">Rules of probability</p>
        <p class="calibre2">When two events are independent (no event can influence the probability of the other), the probability that they both will happen is the product of their individual probabilities. We can write this as: Both A and B will happen= P(A) x P(B).</p>
        <p class="calibre2">A company has two independent manufacturing processes. In process one, 5% of the produced items are defective, and in process two, 3 <span>%. </span><span>If </span>we pick one item from each process, how likely is it that both items are defective? 0.15% (0.05 x 0.03).</p>
        <p class="calibre2">
          <br class="calibre_rescale_" />
        </p>
        <p class="calibre2">This rule is changed if the events are dependent. In many situations the probability of an event depends on the outcome of some other event. Events are often related in a way so that if one event happens, it makes the other event more or less likely to happen. For example, if we toss a die and event A is: observe an even number, and event B: observe a number less than 4, then given we know B has happened, the probability is 1/3. This is called a conditional probability or the probability that an event happen given that some other event has happened. Conditional probabilities involve dependent events. The conditional probability of A given B is 1/3 since we know B was either 1,2 or 3 and only 2 implies event <span>A.</span></p>

Ask: What can happen or what are the number of outcomes that are equally likely to happen? Boy/Boy- Girl/Girl <span>- </span>Boy/Girl <span>- </span>Girl/Boy. Since we already know that there is "at least one boy'; we can rule out scenario "Girl/Girl" The probability is therefore 113 or 33%.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">What is the probability that there are two boys in a two-child family given that the first-born is a boy? The number of outcomes that are equally likely to happen are: Boy/Boy <span>- </span>Girl/Girl <span>- </span>Boy/Girl <span>- </span>Girl/Boy. Since we already know that the older child is a boy, we can rule out scenario GB and GG. The probability is 50%.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">A problem in conditional probability that has caused many mathematics professors problems, is the Monty Hall Dilemma. The columnist Marilyn vos Savant <span>(Parade </span>1990, Sept 9, p. 13.) asked the following problem:</p>
        <p class="calibre2">"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors. Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. l, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, 'Do you want to pick door No. 2?' Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?"</p>
        <p class="calibre2">How would you answer? Assume we always have the opportunity <span>to </span>switch. Make a table of possible outcomes and test in how many outcomes it pays to switch doors.</p>

        <p class="calibre2">165 1 person has 365 possible birthdays if we assume that there are 365 days to choose from and that all birthdays are equally likely to happen. When there are 2 persons in a group the second person can choose among 364 possible birthdays that are not shared with the first person. The second person only shares 1 day with the first person. The chance that 2 persons share birthdays is therefore 1 out of365 or 0.27%. When there are 3 people in a group it is easier to find the likelihood that 2 of them share a birthday by first finding out how likely it is that no one of these 3 people share birthdays. When there are 3 people in a group the third person can choose among 363 possible birthdays that are not shared with any of the first 2 persons. This means that the chance that the third person will not share birthday with any of the first 2 persons is 363 out of365 or 99.45%.</p>
        <p class="calibre2">To find the probability that multiple events happen, we multiply the individual probabilities together.
